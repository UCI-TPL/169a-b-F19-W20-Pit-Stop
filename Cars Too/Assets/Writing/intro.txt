Piper:
THERE you are! I was started to worry you wouldn't show! 

Lightning:
Yeah, well....I figured it would be worth getting the parts I need. Worth even putting up with you.

Piper:
Awwww, that's sweet!

Lightning:
That wasn't a compliment.

Piper:
*laughs* I take what I can get in a post-apocalypse.

Piper:
So let me get introductions started then! I'm Piper!

Lightning:
Uh yeah, I know that already.

Piper:
Never hurts to give a refresher!

Lightning:
We literally JUST spoke. We've also BEEN speaking. For SIX years.

Piper:
Oh fine, spoil all the fun, I'll move onto the people you DON'T know then, gosh. 

Lightning:
That's typically how introductions are supposed to go...

Piper:
So! We have Springtrap, our head of security. She makes sure we stay safe doing what we do. She might seem a bit cold at first, but I'm sure you can warm up to her if you give her the chance!

Piper:
We have Dex, our speeder. He scouts areas for us. He's also got an ego the size of Texas, but he's a lot of fun too!

Piper:
We have Loco, our muscle. He clears debris and makes paths to get to parts we need! He's also...er...hard to get along with, beLIEVE me, I tried.

Lightning:
Oh I don't doubt that.

Piper:
He's a bit of an, um, off-roader, shall we say?

Lightning:
We shan't.

Piper:
But I'm sure he could be a great pal!

Lightning:
Avoiding Loco, got it.

Piper:
And we have Mustang, our tech support! They're just about the most motorific, super driftin', wheels blazin', amAZING automobile this side of the Junkers! 

Lightning:
What are you, their spokesperson?

Piper:
Hah, I WISH! Anyways, say hi when you get the chance!

Piper:
And last but not least, we have Chief! They - !

Chief:
Would like to introduce themself, thank you, Piper.

Piper:
Alright, Chief! Lightning, I'll be in [town center] if you wanna come chat!

Piper:
*leaves*

Lightning:
So, Chief, right?

Chief:
It's a pleasure to meet you, Lightning. You know, Piper's been off her rims waiting for you to arrive.

Lightning:
Can't imagine a good reason why.

Chief:
Heh, well, whether you like it or not, that girl thinks you're somethin'. We'll see if that's true in a minute.

Lightning:
What do you mean?

Chief:
I mean I'm gonna show you the ropes on parts retrieval. The way WE do it. You did come to help out, didn't you?

Lightning:
Y-Yeah. I did.

Chief:
Then let's get started.

End
