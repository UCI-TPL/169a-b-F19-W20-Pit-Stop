Mustang:
What can I do ya for?

Lightning:
Can you tell me a little more about the gadgets you work on?

Mustang:
Oh, my gizmos? Sure, sure!

Mustang:
First of all, I gots a modified fishin' rod that lets me pick up things these ol' tires can't.

Lightning:
Wait, you made the fishing rod too?

Mustang:
That's right!

Lightning:
How'd you manage that? Wish just tires and all?

Mustang:
...I don't appreciate personal questions.
