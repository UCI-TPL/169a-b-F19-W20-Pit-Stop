Lightning:
Hey, just wanted to say sorry, again, about-

Piper:
Hey don't worry about it!

$P0

Piper:
Or, actually, maybe do, a little bit?

$P5

Piper:
I mean, not that I WANT you to like, suffer, I mean, OBVIOUSLY-!

$P6

Lightning:
Piper, it's okay.

Choices
You can be honest with me.
You don't have to be nice.

Piper:
Oh...well....

$P4

Piper:
The truth is, you really hurt me back there.

$P3

Piper:
But...I don't want to hold that over your head forever.

Piper:
I mean...I probably will tease you about it though!

$P5

Lightning:
Hey, that's better than I could've asked for.

Lightning:
I really...don't deserve you guys. 

Lightning:
But I can try to be a person that does.

Lightning:
Starting with dealing with Gak.

End

Piper:
Oh, Lightning-

$P5

Piper:
It's not that I want to be mean!

$P4

Piper:
I just...want you to understand how you hurt us back there.

$P3

Piper:
But it isn't like I want you to feel guilty about it for the rest of your life.

$P5

Lightning:
Hey, that's better than I could've asked for.

Lightning:
I really...don't deserve you guys. 

Lightning:
But I can try to be a person that does.

Lightning:
Starting with dealing with Gak.

End

Lightning:
Hey you ever seen Gak before?

Piper:
No, I hadn't!

$P6

Piper:
It seems like they just popped out of nowhere!

Piper:
You hadn't seen them before, have you?

$P3

EndC

Choices
No, I haven't...
Maybe...

Lightning:
No, I haven't. At least, not until a few hours ago.

Piper:
What got you roped in anyway?

Lightning:
They had a way out. And everyone was gonev so I guess I just...took it.

Lightning:
I'm sorry, Piper.

Piper:
We all make mistakes.

$P5

Piper:
But we're all family now!

$P0

Piper:
It's our job to help each other out.

Piper:
Starting with this Gak wackjob!

End

Lightning:
Actually...I think I might've seen them before...

Piper:
Really!?

$P6

Lightning:
I mean...in a way.

Lightning:
They just wanted a way out, Piper. Like me.

Piper:
I...I guess? But they're not really like you.

$P3

Lightning:
How so? They wanted off, just like I did.

Piper:
But they didn't have me!

$P6

Piper:
Or Dex or Springtrap or Mustang or Chief!

Piper:
You're here, Lightning.

$P0

Piper:
That's the difference!

Piper:
Now let's make a difference on that maniac's paint job!

$P7

Lightning:
Whoa, Springtrap rubbing off on you, huh?

Piper:
A little bit, I guess!
