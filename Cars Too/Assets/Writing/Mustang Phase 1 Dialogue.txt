Mustang:
What can I do ya for?

Lightning:
Can you tell me a little more about the gadgets you work on?

Mustang:
Oh, my gizmos? Sure, sure!

Mustang:
First of all, I gots a modified fishin' rod that lets me pick up things these ol' tires can't.

Lightning:
Wait, you made the fishing rod too?

Mustang:
That's right!

Lightning:
How'd you manage that? Wish just tires and all?

Mustang:
...I don't appreciate personal questions.

Mustang:
Anything new, slick?

Lightning:
So you and Chief are good friends?

Mustang:
Oh, more 'n that! Chief is my partner in crime.

Mustang:
Why they're slicker than a linebacker slidin' down a rattlesnake farm!

Lightning:
Do you...Do you understand everything that comes out of your mouth?

Mustang:
I'll let you in on a little secret-

Mustang:
...

Mustang:
I have never understood a single word I've said in my entire dang life.

Lightning:
Brr.

Mustang:
What's that?

Lightning:
Oh, nothing. I just felt, for some reason, that a lot of people just said "same".
