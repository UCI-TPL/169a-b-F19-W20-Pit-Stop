Lightning:
Hey Dex. How are you doing?

Dex:
I'm motortastic Lightning, what about you?

$D3

Lightning:
Listen I just wanted to say I'm sorry about what happened...

Dex:
It's fine Lightning. I knew you couldn't resist my charm. Let's go get those parts shall we?

$D5

Lightning:
Alright I guess we'll talk later...

End

Lightning:
Are you sure you're alright Dex?

Dex:
No Lightning. You left us after everything! How am I supposed to be ok with it?

$D7

Dex:
We were getting so close. You betrayed us. Me.

$D4

Lightning:
And I was wrong for that. I was only thinking about myself.

Lightning:
I am really sorry for what I did. I realize that what I did was selfish, and that we are stronger together.

Lightning:
I understand if you don't want to speak to me again.

Dex:
*sigh* It's ok. I'll get over it. I'm just glad you're back. Now let's go stop Gak.

Lightning:
Let's do it!.
