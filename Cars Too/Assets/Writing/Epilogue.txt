Chief: 
How you holding up?

Lightning: 
Good. Springtrap patched me up.

Chief:
She give you a hard time?

Lightning:
As always, hah.

Lightning:
...

Lightning:
Have you...heard from Gak?

Chief:
...No. Unfortunately not.

Chief:
Still nothing since that day.

Chief:
When they took off, they really meant it.

Lightning: 
You think they'll be alright?

Chief:
Depends. Personally...

Chief:
I think they'll find someone. Or some people.

Chief:
And they'll be alright. 

Chief:
I think you taught them a thing or two.

Lightning:
Well, nothing you all didn't teach me.

Chief:
What about you?

Chief:
Sticking around this time?

Lightning:
...

Narrator:
(You turn to see the Spirit Crew.)

Narrator:
(Dex is showing off his sweet new moves, while Springtrap watches over him in concern.)

Narrator:
(Piper is laughing beside her and easing her worry with a distraction - a shiny new artifact she just found!)

Narrator:
(And Mustang is looking on, a new schematic in their head and a new goal to march toward.)

Lightning:
(You can't help but smile a little to yourself.)

Lightning:
Yeah.

Lightning:
Yeah, I think so, Chief.
