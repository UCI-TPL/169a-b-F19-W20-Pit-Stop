Lightning:
This is it.


Lightning:
Let's get in there and get those parts back.

Lightning:
Gak!


Gak:
.....


Gak:
Well. If it isn't the delicate little motor come to save the day.


Lightning:
Put. Down. The parts.


Gak:
OR what?? You'll sic one of your little pals on me?

Lightning:
No. I didn't come to hurt you. I came to negotiate.


Gak:
Oh? A trade? Finally decided to speak “my language” huh?


Lightning:
Can you cut the scrap for two seconds, Gak?
 
Lightning:
Look around you! This place is way too unstable for a rocket!


Lightning:
As soon as you try to take off, it's all gonna collapse.


Gak:
Yeah, on YOU. Me? I'll take my chances in a giant metal tube.


Lightning:
If you're not going to stop for your own safety, then just listen to me, okay?


Lightning:
You're making a HUGE mistake doing this.G


Lightning:
And I know because I was going to do the same exact thing. 


Lightning:
I thought this was the only way out too but that's not true anymore.


Gak:
Oh stop being ignorant! You've seen this planet!

Gak:
EVERYTHING IS DEAD.


Lightning:
How can you say that when we're all right here?


Lightning:
US, Gak! We're still here, we're still alive!


Gak:
You can't possibly call this living.


Gak:
Scrounging for scraps? Barely making it by on the shitty tools those humans left us with?


Gak:
How long do you think we'll last here, huh? Everything's limited, and supply is running out fast. 


Lightning:
We can make our own. We can build OUR way.


Lightning:
Why do you keep limiting yourself by what humans did for us?

Lightning:
They aren't here anymore Gak! We aren't fixing things for them, we're fixing things for ourselves!


Lightning:
But you're too stubborn to see that, aren't you?


Gak:
....


Gak:
You don't know anything about me.


Lightning:
Yes I do.


Lightning:
I know you want to think all humans were evil, all humans did this to the planet.


Lightning:
I know you just want someone to blame.


Lightning:
You want this whole world to be irredeemable so leaving can be justified.


Lightning:
You want everyone else to look stupid, look naive, for staying.


Lightning:
“They're just weak.” That's what you're telling yourself, right?


Lightning:
“They're weak but I'm strong.”


Lightning:
You think you're smarter than them. You think you're clever for thinking up this whole scheme.


Lightning:
Well, I hate to brake it to you, but you're no better than the rest of us.


Gak:
YES I AM!


Gak:
I AM better than you! Better than all of you!


Gak:
You'll WASTE these parts! We don't have that many left!


Lightning:
Gak, calm down.


Gak:
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT I'VE BEEN THROUGH TO GET HERE!


Gak:
I can't go back! I've come so far!

Piper:
Yes you can!


Piper:
The past only matters where you let it matter!

Piper:
If you let it destroy you....it destroys you.

Piper:
But if you let it help you, it'll never turn you down.


Piper:
There is always room for growth.


Piper:
The investment from before only matters because you WANT it to matter!


Piper:
But it doesn't!


Piper:
Don't make a terrible mistake just because you don't have the heart to face the past.


Piper:
Because the choice you make RIGHT NOW is the only one that counts.


Piper:
Please...choose the right one.
