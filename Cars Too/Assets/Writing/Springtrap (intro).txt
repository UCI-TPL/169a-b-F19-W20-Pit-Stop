Springtrap:
Yo. You the new motor?

Springtrap:
Piper told me about you.

Lightning:
She did?

Springtrap:
She said you were "wheel-tastic".

Lightning:
Ah. Yeah that sounds like her. 

Springtrap:
I'm not so convinced.

Lightning:
And you are..?

Springtrap:
Name's Springtrap. And all you need to know about me is that these mirrors -

Springtrap:
- are on YOU. You try anything funny, I'll personally break your hubcaps. Got it?

Lightning:
Yeah, quick question, do ALL of you make car puns? Or is it just-

Springtrap:
I said GOT IT?! 

Lightning:
Loud and clear. Emphasis on "loud". 

Springtrap:
Good. I'm the only troublemaker 'round here, and don't you forget it.

Lightning:
Yes, ma'am.

Lightning:
I'll see you later then, I guess. Or at least...you'll see me?

Springtrap:
Damn right. Better watch your rearview.
