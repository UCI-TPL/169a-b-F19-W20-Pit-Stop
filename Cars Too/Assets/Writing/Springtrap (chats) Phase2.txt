Lightning:
How was fixing the bridge?

Springtrap:
Oh that old thing? No problemo.

$S3

Springtrap:
Human mechanical engineering ain't no Sunday drive-

$S0

Springtrap:
But once you really take a look under the hood, it's no biggie.

EndC

Choices
You must be good with tools.
Boasting, much?

Springtrap:
You betcha.

Springtrap:
All the more reason, you should be keeping your headlights on your OWN road.

$S7

Springtrap:
Don't wanna be caught at the business end of one of THESE do ya?

$S0

Lightning:
True.

Lightning:
Although, if that's the case, why aren't you helping Mustang? They kinda seem on their own in getting the device up and running.

Springtrap:
Yeah, ANALOG engineering is more my speed. Mustang's got the market cornered on programming smarts.

$S5

Springtrap:
When they're not going on about their hat, they're going on about some "new fangled gizmo" or other. 

$S0

Lightning:
Do you...want to know programming?

Springtrap:
Eh, maybe sometime.

$S5

Springtrap:
Anyway, I gotta get back to work. Stop getting me sidetracked!

$S0

End

Springtrap:
Ohoh...you think THAT'S boasting?

$S2

Springtrap:
In terms of self-indulgence, I ain't got NOTHIN' on Dex.

$S0

Springtrap:
'Sides, I got every right to be boastin' 'bout this. Got everyone across, didn't I?

Lightning:
True.

End

Springtrap:
Got somethin' to say?

$S0

Lightning:
Just a "thank-you" for fixing the bridge. 

Lightning:
This place looks like it's got a lot of parts for the Crew. 

Lightning:
And we wouldn't even have got here if you hadn't have fixed the bridge.

Springtrap:
O-Oh. Er, yeah. Sure.

$S3

Lightning:
Heh, don't get compliments often?

Springtrap:
*scoffs* More like, I don't get thank-you's often.

$S5 

Lightning:
Hey, what'd you expect? I thought you were the "rebel motor"? 

Lightning:
I don't think a ton of gratitude comes with the field.

Springtrap:
Yeah, I've got a bit of an attitude, but...

Springtrap:
I guess I sorta expected my actions to speak louder than my big mouth.

EndC

Choices
That's kinda stupid
That's kinda sad

Springtrap:
!?

$S1

Springtrap:
You wanna rePEAT THAT-

$S6

Lightning:
OKAY WAIT WAIT-

Lightning:
Poorly worded, lemme backpedal.

Lightning:
What I meant was, if you want more gratitude-

Springtrap:
I should be more happy-go-lucky? 

$S5

Springtrap:
Yeah, no, that's more Piper's shtick-

$S0

Lightning:
OH yeah no, Piper's pretty much got a monopoly on the "cheery" market.

Lightning:
But if you want more gratitude-

Lightning:
Isn't it just...a LITTLE bit dumb to expect it when you put out vibes saying you don't want it?

Lightning:
If you think you deserve it, just ask for it.

Lightning:
I think you of all people shouldn't have a problem doing that much, right?

Springtrap:
Uh, well...it just felt...kinda icky to ASK to be thanked.

$S5

Lightning:
Springtrap, I don't think your street cred will be in ANY jeopardy if that's what you're worried about.

Lightning:
So, what do you think?

Springtrap:
...

Springtrap:
Well, YOU'RE WELCOME, I guess, for the security work I do...

Springtrap:
So...

Lightning:
Thank you, Springtrap. I think it's pretty cool that you do a lot to keep the Crew safe.

Springtrap:
...

$S0

Lightning:
So...?

Springtrap:
That wasn't...TERRIBLE.

$S5

Springtrap:
But I think I need to work a bit on it, still.

$S3

Springtrap:
Either way...thanks Lightning.

$S0

Springtrap:
You're alright.

Lightning:
I feel like it just...kinda sucks that you think people aren't grateful.

Lightning:
The Spirit Crew probably thanks you more often than you realize. And..

Lightning:
If you think you deserve it, just ask for it.

Lightning:
I think you of all people shouldn't have a problem doing that much, right?
