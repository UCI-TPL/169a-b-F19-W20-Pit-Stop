Lightning:
Hey Dex. You mentioned some racing tricks earlier, so I-

Dex:
Ohohohoho!

$D2

Dex:
Say no more, citizen! It would be my absolute PLEASURE to dazzle you with them! 

$D0

Lightning:
That's actually not what-

Dex:
ONWARD!

$D2

Narrator:
(After some STUNNING racing tricks by Dex...)

Dex:
And THAT is how you perform a backspin into a triple axel...

$D0

Dex:
...as a car.

$D5

Lightning:
Oh is that what that was? It kinda looked like you just hopped on your axles a few times.

$D0

Dex:
Exactly!

$D2

Dex:
A triple-

$D5

Dex:
AXLE!

$D0

Lightning:
Good grief.

Dex:
Might you have any personal requests for a trick?

Dex:
OH! Or a race? Granted, you won't win, but seeing me in action is sure to be a trophy in itself!

$D2

Lightning:
Nope, I think I'm good for now. 

$D0

Dex:
Ah well. Another time then! As I've mentioned before, anything racing or trick related -

$D3

Dex:
I'm your car.

$D5

EndC

Choices
How did you get into racing?
How did you get into tricks?

Dex:
Oh well that's easy!

$D2

Dex:
As you can tell, my model is a sports car, and not just ANY sports car-

$D0

Dex:
The BEST sports car. 

$D5

Dex:
It was the most recent model developed before the Crash. 

$D0

Dex:
So when I awoke, well -

Dex:
It was only natural for me to speed right out of that garage and hit that wide open dirt road.

Dex:
To bolt across incredible distances faster than the starter can yell “GO!” -

Dex:
To veer corners at speeds that would take a human's breath away in an instant -

$D3

Dex:
Why, it's simply breathtaking just to think about! It's no wonder I picked up the skill so fast.

$D0

Dex:
*laughs* When I started out, I wanted to race everything I came across!

$D2

Dex:
A tumbleweed, the clouds, anything that moved!

$D0

Dex:
Which was silly of me, I know, but since then I've learned.

$D3

Dex:
Now it's obvious that WIND is the real challenge. One day I'm sure to beat the coward.

$D7

End

Dex:
Oh well that's easy!

$D2

Dex:
As you can tell, my model is a sports car, and not just ANY sports car-

$D0

Dex:
The BEST sports car. 

$D5

Dex:
It was the most recent model developed before the Crash. 

$D0

Dex:
So when I awoke, I realized my increased dexterity compared to other cars.

Dex:
It gave me a boost in my cylinders when I first realized how smoothly my tires could turn over a surface -

Dex:
- just feeling the road slip beneath you, almost like ice.

$D3

Dex:
It's exhilarating just to think about it! 

$D2

Dex:
On one hand - or, tire, if you will - when you spin out, it's so fast that when it's over, you can barely come to terms with what just happened. 

$D3

Dex:
But on the other tire, in the moment, you wonder if it'll ever end.

$D0

Dex:
That feeling is what I'll always be chasing, but in the meantime, I'll have to make do with coming up with new, better tricks!

Dex:
Ones that humans would've never even dreamed of! 

Dex:
Triple axel? Why stop there? How about Quadruple? Sextuple? Sky's the limit!

$D2

Dex:
One day, I'll be able to do a Septuple into a full-on-

$D0

Dex:
Backflip! 

Lightning:
As a car?

Dex:
Of course!

End

Lightning:
Okay, see, I know that's impossible, but your bravado ALMOST makes me believe you.

$D0

Dex:
*laughs* Excellent! Confidence is the key to every success, and I'm very glad I've never lost sight of that.

$D2

Dex:
When you know in your engine what you're built for, it feels like magic to do it.

$D0

EndC
Isn't gas a problem for you?
Don't you need tune-ups?

Dex:
Ah, well, yes and no.

$D3

Dex:
You see, when I first awoke and immediately bolted across the countryside, I hadn't quite realized one simple fact -

$D0

Lightning:
That cars need fuel?

Dex:
- that cars need-

Dex:
...Yes, that.

$D5

Dex:
I woefully ended up stranded in the middle of nowhere with nothing but desert weeds to keep me company.

$D0

Dex:
A very MINOR setback, of course.

$D5

Lightning:
I don't think that's quite how any other car would phrase that.

Dex:
Anyhow, I would still be out there if it weren't for Chief!

$D0

Dex:
Why, they found me and hauled me to the gas tanks themselves!

Dex:
I will forever be in their debt for that. 

End

Dex:
Tune-ups?

$D6

Dex:
*laughs* Of course I do!

$D2

Dex:
My model is HIGHLY sensitive!

Dex:
And Piper has also informed me that I was also highly expensive!

$D0 

Lightning:
Ah to be objectified and worth a literal pile of money.

Dex:
Ah yes! To have a price on your soul!

$D2

Dex:
Now THAT would be the life!

Dex:
And all those expenses come from the fact that I am indeed difficult to take care of.

$D0

Lightning:
In more than one way, I'm presuming.

Dex:
So getting regular tune-ups is incredibly important.

Dex:
Chief is normally the one to do the tune-up, but on very very lucky days, Springtrap does it!

Lightning:
Whoa, really? I thought she hated you.

Dex:
Oh absolutely! Which is why it's so amusing when she's the one who has to do what I say!

$D5

Lightning:
Wow. Sounds cathartic. 

Dex:
Sometimes! But to be honest, I'm very grateful that the tune-ups get done at all.

$D3

End

Dex:
Nowadays, supplies is handled and distributed as Chief sees fit!

$D0

Dex:
Which is great because it means I get pampered the most!

$D2

Lightning:
Ah, yes, as you should.

$D0

Dex:
Exactly!

$D5

Dex:
Being a sports car, I require an awful lot of maintenance.

$D0

Dex:
But of course, you can't argue with results.

Dex:
As the fastest one here, I do all the scouting and exploration with both efficiency AND -

Narrator:
(Dex strikes a stunning pose!)

$D5

Dex:
Finesse!

Lightning:
*laughs* 

Dex:
Oh! 

$D6

Dex:
So the quiet one DOES laugh?

$D1

Lightning:
...

$D2

Lightning:
AHEM. Occasionally. 

Dex:
...

$D5

Lightning:
What? I'm not a robot.

Dex:
I didn't say anything! But I appreciate hearing your amusement!

$D2

Dex:
We should do this more often, Lightning! 

$D0

Dex:
This was fun!

$D2
