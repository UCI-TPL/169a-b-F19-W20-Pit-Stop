Lightning:
Hey Dex. You mentioned some racing tricks earlier, so I-

Dex:
Ohohohoho!

Dex:
Say no more, citizen! It would be my absolute PLEASURE to dazzle you with them! 

Lightning:
That’s actually not what-

Dex:
ONWARD!

Dex:
And THAT is how you perform a backspin into a triple axel...

Dex:
...as a car.

Lightning:
Oh is that what that was? It kinda just looked like you just hopped on your axles a few times.

Dex:
Exactly!

Dex:
A triple-

Dex:
AXLE!

Lightning:
Good grief.

Dex:
Might you have any personal requests for a trick?

Dex:
OH! Or a race? Granted, you won’t win, but seeing me in action is sure to be a trophy in itself!
Lightning:
Nope, I think I’m good for now. 

Dex:
Ah well. Another time then! As I’ve mentioned before, anything racing or trick related -

Dex:
I’m your car.

EndC

Choices
How did you get into racing?
How did you get into tricks?

Dex:
Oh well that’s easy!

Dex:
As you can tell, my model is a sports car, and not just ANY sports car-

Dex:
The BEST sports car. 

Dex:
It was the most recent model developed before the Crash. 

Dex:
So when I awoke, well -

Dex:
It was only natural for me to speed right out of that garage and hit that wide open dirt road.

Dex:
To bolt across incredible distances faster than the starter can yell “GO!” -

Dex:
To veer corners at speeds that would take a human’s breath away in an instant -

Dex:
Why, it’s simply breathtaking just to think about! It’s no wonder I picked up the skill so fast.

Dex:
*laughs* When I started out, I wanted to race everything I came across!

Dex:
A tumbleweed, the clouds, anything that moved!

Dex:
Which was silly of me, I know, but since then I’ve learned.

Dex:
Now it’s obvious that WIND is the real challenge. One day I’m sure to beat the coward.

End

Dex:
Oh well that’s easy!

Dex:
As you can tell, my model is a sports car, and not just ANY sports car-

Dex:
The BEST sports car. 

Dex:
It was the most recent model developed before the Crash. 

Dex:
So when I awoke, I realized my increased dexterity compared to other cars.

Dex:
It gave me a boost in my cylinders when I first realized how smoothly my tires could turn over a surface -

Dex:
- just feeling the road slip beneath you, almost like ice.

Dex:
It’s exhilarating just to think about it! On one tire, when you spin out, it’s so fast that when it’s over, you can barely come to terms with what just happened. 

Dex:
But on the other tire, in the moment, you wonder if it’ll ever end.

Dex:
That feeling is what I’ll always be chasing, but in the meantime, I’ll have to make do with coming up with new, better tricks!

Dex:
Ones that humans would’ve never even dreamed of! 

Dex:
Triple axel? Why stop there? How about Quadruple? Sextuple? Sky’s the limit!

Dex:
One day, I’ll be able to do a Septuple into a full-on-

Dex:
Backflip! 

Lightning:
As a car?

Dex:
Of course!

End

Lightning:
Okay, see, I know that’s impossible, but your bravado almost makes me believe you.

Dex:
*laughs* Excellent! Confidence is the key to every success, and I’m very glad I’ve never lost sight of that.

Dex:
When you know in your engine what you’re built for, it feels like magic to do it.

EndC
Isn’t gas a problem for you?
Don’t you need tune-ups?

Dex:
Ah, well, yes and no.

Dex:
You see, when I first awoke and immediately bolt across the countryside, I hadn’t quite realized one simple fact -

Lightning:
That cars need fuel?

Dex:
- that cars need-

Dex:
...Yes, that.

Dex:
I woefully ended up stranded in the middle of nowhere with nothing but desert weeds to keep me company.

Dex:
A very MINOR setback, of course.

Lightning:
I don’t think that’s quite how any other car would phrase that.

Dex:
Anyhow, I would still be out there if it weren’t for Chief!

Dex:
Why, they found me and hauled me to the gas tanks themselves!

Dex:
I will forever be in their debt for that. 

End

Dex:
Tune-ups?

Dex:
*laughs* Of course I do!

Dex:
My model is HIGHLY sensitive!

Dex:
And Piper has also informed me that I was also highly expensive! 

Lightning:
Ah to be objectified and worth a literal pile of money.

Dex:
Ah yes! To have a price on your soul!

Dex:
Now THAT would be the life!

Dex:
And all those expenses come from the fact that I am indeed difficult to take care of.

Lightning:
In more than one way, I’m presuming.

Dex:
So getting regular tune-ups is incredibly important.

Dex:
Chief is normally the one to do the tune-up, but on very very lucky days, Springtrap does it!

Lightning:
Whoa, really? I thought she hated you.

Dex:
Oh absolutely! Which is why it’s so amusing when she’s the one who has to do what I say!

Lightning:
Wow. Sounds cathartic. 

Dex:
Sometimes! But to be honest, I’m very grateful that the tune-ups get done at all.

End

Dex:
Nowadays, supplies is handled and distributed as Chief sees fit!

Dex:
Which is great because it means I get pampered the most!

Lightning:
Ah, yes, as you should.

Dex:
Exactly!

Dex:
Being a sports car, I require an awful lot of maintenance.

Dex:
But of course, you can’t argue with results.

Dex:
As the fastest one here, I do all the scouting and exploration with both efficiency AND -

Dex:
*strikes a pose* Finesse!

Lightning:
*laughs* 

Dex:
Oh! So the quiet one DOES laugh?

Lightning:
...

Lightning:
AHEM. Occasionally. 

Dex:
...

Lightning:
What? I’m not a robot.

Dex:
I didn’t say anything! But I appreciate hearing your amusement!

Dex:
We should do this more often, Lightning! 

Dex:
This was fun!
