Lightning:
Hey, Springtrap.

Springtrap:
......

$S0

Lightning:
...Listen, I-

Springtrap:
Look, I'm glad you made it out.

Springtrap:
But...

$S5

Springtrap:
I'm still working through some things right now, alright?

Springtrap:
So, leave me alone.

Springtrap:
Please.

End

Springtrap:
Back again?

$S7

Lightning:
Look, I really wanted to apologize, ESPECIALLY to you.

Lightning:
I made a mistake.

Lightning:
And I'm sorry, I hurt you, Springtrap.

Springtrap:
Hurt me? Psh, are you KIDDING?

Springtrap:
You just ANNOYED me, that's all. 

$S3

Springtrap:
It's not like.....

$S5

Springtrap:
.....

$S4

Springtrap:
Oh, WHATEVER. 

$S6

Springtrap:
You know what? Yes. Yes, you did hurt me. 

Springtrap:
After the talk we had...and all that....

$S5

Springtrap:
I thought that maybe, you got me. Maybe, someone other than Piper, actually GOT me.

Springtrap:
Did you lie about that, too?

$S4

Lightning:
....I....I don't think so.

Springtrap:
You don't THINK so?

$S3

Lightning:
I mean, the truth is....I really didn't know what I was doing.

Lightning:
I wanted the parts, but...the more I got to know everyone....I just...

Lightning:
I got lost, I think. And I'm sorry.

Springtrap:
...

Springtrap:
....Well, you know what the best apology for me would be?

$S0

Springtrap:
Getting in there and kicking that Gak's fender!

$S2

Lightning:
Ah, back to violence, are we?

Springtrap:
Hey, it's cathartic sometimes.

$S0

Springtrap:
But if you wanna talk things out afterwards...

$S5

Springtrap:
I'll be here for ya when you get out.

$S0
