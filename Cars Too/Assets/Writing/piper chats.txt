Piper:
What's revvin'?

Lightning:
What's with the lame catchphrase?


Piper:
Oh, Lightning. One of these days, you're going to have to lean into the whole "being a car" thing. It's so much more fun!

$P5

Lightning:
I really don't see how making dumb puns is going to brighten my day.


Piper:
Sure it will! Try it!

Choices
Call me a car brand, cuz I'd rather Dodge the idea.
I think I'd rather leave. Call me a car brand, cuz I'm Audi.


Piper:
*laughs*

Piper:
See, you'll get the hang of it!

Piper:
And what about your avatar?

Lightning:
Oh, that's...not really my style.

Piper:
Oh, come on! You've GOTTA have one, we all do!

$P2

Lightning:
What's wrong with just Ågbeing a carÅh? It looks like that other yellow car doesn't care either-


Piper:
But I wanna see it! Being a car is cool and all, but isn't it neat that we have these extra forms we can take!

$P0

Piper:
I feel like I can express myself so much more naturally like this!

$P2

Lightning:
Yeah...like I said: Not my style.

Piper:
Whatever you say!

Lightning:
Is there a reason you decided to call yourself Piper?

Piper:
Well, firstly, I've got this NIFTY HAT! So, like, how could I not?

$P0

Piper:
Secondly, they are just SO NEAT! 

Lightning:
What are? 

Piper:
PIPES! Are you kidding me! They're just so cool! There's so much they can do and so many things they're important for - they're amazing!

Lightning:

Piper:
Hah, as if there were a fanclub -

$P5

Piper:
*GASP*

$P6

Piper:
OMG, A PIPES FANCLUB!? Wouldn't that be motorific!

$P2

Lightning:
Oh boy.

Piper:
There could be weekly meetings where we could talk about a different pipe each week, and maybe - OH - maybe like, a-a CONTEST where we each bring in our favorite pipe and...!

Piper:
*continues talking on and on in increasingly greater detail about a pipes fanclub*

Lightning:
I'd better leave before I end up her vice president and treasurer.
