Piper:
Hooray! You found your first part!

Lightning:
You're actually excited about that?

Piper:
We had a deal didn't we? 

Piper:
I just want to hold up my end of the bargain!

Lightning:
Even if you're end of the bargain helps me get off-planet?

Piper:
*sighs* Yes, even if that's still your plan.

Piper:
Lightning, I know you only came because you knew we had the parts you could use to help build your rocket or whatever, but..

Piper:
I hope as you spend more time with the Spirit, you'll see how motorific it is!

Lightning:
Piper, I'm not gonna change my mind. Don't you see what this wasteland's turned into?

Lightning:
There's nothing but junk. I'm better off somewhere far away from here.

Piper:
But don't you see what this wasteland was? There were people and there was life!

Piper:
We could build something new! Something just for us! The world is ours now, don't you see that?

Lightning:
No, I don't. All I see is a big fat pile of-

???:
Yo!

Springtrap:
Somethin' goin' on here I should know about?

Piper:
Springtrap, Dex! You're back from scouting?

Dex:
Yes, we have returned! Did you miss me and my radiance?

Springtrap:
Ugh.

Piper:
What did you find?

Dex:
Oh have we got a haul for you!

Dex:
There's a valley just west of here that looks to be filled with parts! Though there's an eensy weensy teeny tiny problem-

Springtrap:
The bridge is completely blown out.

Dex:
A minor inconvenience! Luckily I'm the fastest car awake, so jumping it won't be a-!

Springtrap:
DEX! You're not going to be jumping ANYTHING. We are FIXING the bridge like normal people so that we can move supplies back and forth.

Springtrap:
We'll be over by the border. I'll see ya, Piper.

Piper:
Take care!

Piper:
Lightning, remember to introduce yourself when you have the time.

Lightning:
But-

Piper:
Please!? Remember the deal?

Lightning:
...

Lightning:
Ugh, fine.
