Lightning:
This factory seems like it's been abandoned for a long time. What do you think this factory made?

Mustang:
From the scattered parts here, I'd say parts were made here.

Lightning:
Parts? Parts for what?

Mustang:
Beats me. These parts look like they can be used for a toy or a spaceship.

Mustang:
I wanna say these parts are universal and can be used in different places.

Lightning:
These parts are very useful then. I'll go gather some more.

Mustang:
Catch you on the drift!

End

Mustang:
Lightning, you would not believe the things this place has!

Lightning:
What did you find Mustang?

Mustang:
I found this fantastic long distance radio. It's very old but functional. The humans might have made it.

Lightning:
That sure can be helpful for long distance communication.

Mustang:
My thoughts exactly!

Mustang:
We can use this to split up far and wide to scavange for parts while remaining in contact.

Lightning:
It sounds like you should probably let Chief know about this new discovery of yours.

Mustang:
I sure will. I gotta get to work on setting up the frequencies and fixin' it. Chat with ya later!
