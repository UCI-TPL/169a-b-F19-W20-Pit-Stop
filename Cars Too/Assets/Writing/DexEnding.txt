Lightning:
This is it.


Lightning:
Let's get in there and get those parts back.

Lightning:
Gak!


Gak:
.....


Gak:
Well. If it isn't the delicate little motor come to save the day.


Lightning:
Put. Down. The parts.


Gak:
OR what?? You'll sic one of your little pals on me?

Lightning:
No. I didn't come to hurt you. I came to negotiate.


Gak:
Oh? A trade? Finally decided to speak “my language” huh?


Lightning:
Can you cut the scrap for two seconds, Gak?
 
Lightning:
Look around you! This place is way too unstable for a rocket!


Lightning:
As soon as you try to take off, it's all gonna collapse.


Gak:
Yeah, on YOU. Me? I'll take my chances in a giant metal tube.


Lightning:
If you're not going to stop for your own safety, then just listen to me, okay?


Lightning:
You're making a HUGE mistake doing this.G


Lightning:
And I know because I was going to do the same exact thing. 


Lightning:
I thought this was the only way out too but that's not true anymore.


Gak:
Oh stop being ignorant! You've seen this planet!

Gak:
EVERYTHING IS DEAD.


Lightning:
How can you say that when we're all right here?


Lightning:
US, Gak! We're still here, we're still alive!


Gak:
You can't possibly call this living.


Gak:
Scrounging for scraps? Barely making it by on the shitty tools those humans left us with?


Gak:
How long do you think we'll last here, huh? Everything's limited, and supply is running out fast. 


Lightning:
We can make our own. We can build OUR way.


Lightning:
Why do you keep limiting yourself by what humans did for us?

Lightning:
They aren't here anymore Gak! We aren't fixing things for them, we're fixing things for ourselves!


Lightning:
But you're too stubborn to see that, aren't you?


Gak:
....


Gak:
You don't know anything about me.


Lightning:
Yes I do.


Lightning:
I know you want to think all humans were evil, all humans did this to the planet.


Lightning:
I know you just want someone to blame.


Lightning:
You want this whole world to be irredeemable so leaving can be justified.


Lightning:
You want everyone else to look stupid, look naive, for staying.


Lightning:
“They're just weak.” That's what you're telling yourself, right?


Lightning:
“They're weak but I'm strong.”


Lightning:
You think you're smarter than them. You think you're clever for thinking up this whole scheme.


Lightning:
Well, I hate to brake it to you, but you're no better than the rest of us.


Gak:
YES I AM!


Gak:
I AM better than you! Better than all of you!


Gak:
You'll WASTE these parts! We don't have that many left!


Lightning:
Gak, calm down.


Gak:
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT I'VE BEEN THROUGH TO GET HERE!


Gak:
I can't go back! I've come so far!

Dex:
You're absolutely right.


Dex:
We have no idea what you've been through.


Dex:
But take it from me, I know how it feels to be stuck.


Dex:
To feel trapped here.


Dex:
With your skills, your rocket- Why-!?


Dex:
No wonder you feel like you aren't reaching your true potential!


Lightning:
Dex, we need to stop him from taking off, not give him a pep talk-!


Dex:
I am! Just trust me, Lightning, dear.


Dex:
Gak! There is great respect in aspiring to reach perfection in your skillset.


Dex:
But when you use your skills to only hurt others, then it isn't worth anything at all.


Dex:
You can change so much with the power you have, but only if you use it the right way!


Dex:
I would tell you to chase your dreams, but only if they weren't our nightmares! 


Dex:
So, Gak, I ask you. Is this a nightmare?


Gak:
....


Gak:
I-....


Gak:
I've lost too much.


Gak:
They're all gone.


Lightning:
I'm sorry. I don't know what it's like to lose someone forever...but...


Lightning:
I know you'll only regret it if you let it define you.


Lightning:
You are more than your losses. And we can make this world bigger than its losses too.


Gak:
....


Gak:
*sigh* I'm not getting out of this am I?


Lightning:
You've got two choices. And one of them isn't pretty.


Gak:
Then there's only one thing to do.


Narrator:
*Gak picks up their tools and parts*


Gak:
Let's get the hell out of here.


Lightning:
Let's move!
