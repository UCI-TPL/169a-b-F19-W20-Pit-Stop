Lightning:
Hey Dex, think you could show me more of those tricks?

Dex:
Think? Oh, I KNOW I can! C’mon!

Dex:
And THAT is how one performs a perfect aerial cartwheel.

Lightning:
Which is...hopping in the air and turning your wheel.

Dex:
Precisely! An “aerial” cart-“wheel”.

Lightning:
*laughs* Wow, okay. 

Dex:
And what about you?

Lightning:
Me?

Dex:
Sure! You must have learned some bold techniques out on the dust trail, all on your own.

Lightning:
Really? You want to learn tricks from li’l ol’, amateur me?

Dex:
Oh, Lightning. NO ONE gets this good without learning a bit from others!

Lightning:
And there it is.

Lightning:
Well, I hate to brake it to you, but I didn’t learn anything flashy out there on my own.

Lightning:
There isn’t really an audience out in the desert.

Dex:
That’s not true! There’s always an audience!

Dex:
You!

Dex:
Why, I impress myself all the time!

Lightning:
I’m not surprised.

Dex:
There must be SOMETHING that impresses you!

Lightning:
Well...

Choices
I’m good at navigating.
I’m good at being on my own.

Lightning:
Well, I guess you could say I’m good at navigating.

Lightning:
There aren’t very many great landmarks in the desert, but I always knew where I was.

Dex:
Really? How did you manage that?

Lightning:
The stars. It’s actually pretty easy when you get the hang of it. 

Lightning:
There’s one bright star in the sky that always stays in the northern direction.

Lightning:
So as long as you know the cardinal directions, you’ll know which way you’re going. 

Dex:
What about certain places? Even if you know all the directions, surely the stars can’t serve as landmarks for everything.

Lightning:
That’s true. Stars move fairly frequently, so it’s impossible for them to really mark any specific place on their own. 

Lightning:
But if you know the speed at which they rotate, it becomes simple!

Lightning:
As long as there’s a night sky, I’ll never get lost.

End

Lightning:
I mean...if I had to choose, I suppose I’m good at being on my own.

Dex:
On your own? Like when you were in the desert?

Lightning:
Yeah. I didn’t really care about other people. No offense.

Dex:
None taken! I think I’d go crazy with no one else.

Dex:
I mean look at me! I was always meant for display, not storage!

Lightning:
Yeah, I can’t imagine someone like you being kept on the shelf.

Dex:
Precisely! So how did you do it?
Lightning:
I roamed, I scavenged. I found full gas stations I could drive between and I found parts to maintain myself. 

Lightning:
But it’s not like I did do more than survive, to be honest. 

Lightning:
I wasn’t living...not really.

Dex:
But still...

End

Dex:
That’s amazing!

Lightning:
Really?

Dex:
Of course! To be able to do all that on your own is a feat in itself!

Lightning:
Well, Piper always complains when I do things on my own.

Dex:
As she should!

Lightning:
Huh?

Dex:
Being independent is one thing, but what good are stars like us if we don’t share the gifts we have!

Lightning:
I...never thought of it that way.

Dex:
You should start then, Lightning. Maybe one day you could become a celebrity like me~!

Lightning:
Uh, I don’t know about that...

Dex:
You never know! It’d be quite the challenge!

Lightning:
Hey, I have a question for you, Dex.

Dex:
Fire away!

Choices
What’s your favorite place you’ve been to?
What’s the farthest you’ve gone?

Dex:
Oh, now that’s tricky.

Dex:
I’ve sped all over this county, I’ve been to so many places.

Dex:
It almost seems impossible to choose but there’s one place that’s always been one I go back to.

Dex:
The Colosseum.

Lightning:
The Colosseum? Where’s that?

Dex:
Oh it’s this magnificent place some tens of miles north of here.

Dex:
And it’s the most beautiful place I’ve ever seen.

Lightning:
Lemme guess. It’s a race track?

Dex:
You bet your exhaust pipes it’s a race track!

Dex:
And not just any race track! It’s a NOT-collapsed race track!

Dex:
The road, the stands, the walls, everything’s intact still!

Dex:
I like to think it’s the spirit of all those fans, holding the place together in hopes of seeing just one more race car zoom past!

Dex:
To feel just one more rush of excitement as rubber burns over the finish line.

Dex:
When Chief lets me, I’ll take a trip up there to brush up on my tricks.

Dex:
It almost feels like home.

Lightning:
Almost?

Dex:
Yeah. In the end...

Dex:
The Spirit will always be my real home.

End

Dex:
Oh, have I got a story for you!

Dex:
When I was out speeding without a care in the world -

Lightning:
Because you forgot gas tanks exist and have limits...

Dex:
Right, right, ANYWAY -

Dex:
When I was out there, in the vast world, I saw places you wouldn’t believe!

Dex:
HUGE towers! Some barely standing, some crumbled in a heap. 

Dex:
And long, wide rivers, crashing in anger at times, and bubbling along peacefully other times.

Dex:
But the farthest I went was way way up north.

Dex:
Where I saw snow.

Lightning:
You saw snow? REAL snow?

Dex:
Yep! Of course, not much. Piper still believes I was imagining it because at that time, my gas was running pretty low, but I swear it was there!

Dex:
The tiniest patch, just sitting there in the dry grass.

Dex:
And then a snowflake. A SNOWFLAKE, can you believe that!

Dex:
Fell right on my hood. I’ve never seen anything like it. Not by then or since.

Dex:
It melted just an hour later. 

Dex:
You know, that’s part of the reason I’m still with the Spirit.

Dex:
After that, you’d think all I’d want to do is chase snow in the wilderness, but-

Dex:
If there’s even the smallest chance that Mustang can bring any of that back, any of those colors we’ve lost...

Dex:
Then I’ll be there!

End

Dex:
Even when the crew can drive me crazy sometimes, I don’t know where I’d be without them by my side, especially Chief.

Lightning:
Are you close to Chief?

Dex:
Well, they’re the leader after all!

Dex:
I don’t see a reason not to be!

Dex:
One day, that might be me, dishing out orders.

Dex:
I’ve got to be prepared if that ever happens!

Dex:
*laughs* I don’t know if I could ever be as great as Chief is though!

Lightning:
Well, you never know. 

Dex:
True!

Lightning:
I suppose you should probably learn humility first.

Dex:
Hmmmmm I don’t know that one!

Dex:
Is it a trick?

Lightning:
Er...How about we talk about it next time?

Dex:
Sounds good!
