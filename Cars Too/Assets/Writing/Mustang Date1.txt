Lightning:
Hey, any chance you'd show me your workshop?

Mustang:
My workshop? Where all them gizmos are put together?

Lightning:
Yeah. I'd like to see it.

Mustang:
Well, tough luck. It's gated, padlocked, laser-enforced, and guarded by vicious hounds.

Lightning:
Uh, seriously?

Mustang:
Well, one of those might be a fabrication.

Mustang:
But you have no IDEA which one.

Lightning:
Well, I was kinda thinking, YOU would take me?

Mustang:
?? Oh?

Mustang:
Well now, not just ANYONE gets into my workshop.

Mustang:
But, I'll tell ya what. You answer some questions, MAYBE I'll let you have the passcode.

Lightning:
Oh, that's alright, I don't really need to-

Mustang:
Nah, hey, wait! C'mon now, no one's asked to get into my workshop before!

Mustang:
I figured it'd be fun to finally try out the questions on someone who actually wanted to!
Lightning:
Er.....well, okay.

Mustang:
Bust my boots, let's get these riddles started!

Lightning:
Wait, riddles?

Mustang:
Yep! Made 'em myself. Alright, first one-

Mustang:
I am not man, I am not car,
However, I can still wind up pretty far.

Mustang:
I sit atop a head of steel, 
That, somehow, can learn and feel.

Mustang:
What am I?

EndC

Choices
I have no idea.
Can you say it again?

Mustang:
Awh, come on! You sure you wanna give up already?

Lightning:
Yeah, I'm not really a riddle person-

Mustang:
Well, lemme just say it again-

End

Mustang:
Sure thing!

End

Mustang:
I am not man, I am not car,
However, I can still wind up pretty far.

Mustang:
I sit atop a head of steel, 
That, somehow, can learn and feel.

Mustang:
What am I?

EndC

Choices
Is it your hat?
Is it Dex's hair?

Lightning:
Uh....is it your hat?

Mustang:
Ding ding ding!

Mustang:
You're our lucky winner! 

Mustang:
Alright, next one!

End

Lightning:
Uh...psh, I dunno, Dex's hair?

Mustang:
EEEEHRRRRRRR wrong answer!

Mustang:
Sorry, the right answer is -

Mustang:
My hat!

Lightning:
Oh, darn. Oh well.

Mustang:
That's alright, slick! You'll get it on the next one!

End

Lightning:
Next one-?

Mustang:
I do not hurt, I do not harm,
But many folks say I got a lot of charm-

Lightning:
Is it your hat again?

Mustang:
-I do not walk, I do not drive,
But atop this roof, I do indeed thrive!

Lightning:
Are they all your hat?

Mustang:
What am I?

Lightning:
.....

Mustang:
.....

Lightning:
...Is it your hat?

Mustang:
Ding ding ding! 

Lightning:
Good grief.

Mustang:
Heheh, alright I'll quit messin' with ya. Even though it's fun.

Mustang:
Let's get onto the real questions.

Lightning:
There are REAL questions?

Lightning:
I was kinda hoping they'd all be different variations of the exact same riddle.

Mustang:
Oh we can always go back to that! 

Mustang:
Achem!

Mustang:
To what a gaze-

Lightning:
NO, No, no I'll take the real questions please.

Mustang:
Heheh, alrighty then.

Mustang:
First up, what're you doing here?

Lightning:
I'm here because Piper had me-

Mustang:
No, no, not that.

Mustang:
Why're you REALLY here?

Lightning:
Er, I'm...I'm not sure what you mean-

Mustang:
I mean I wanna hear it straight from the horse's mouth!

Mustang:
YOU tell me why you're here, don't wanna hear it from no one else.

Lightning:
Oh, I see. Okay, well-

EndC

Choices
I'm here because Piper forced me to be.
I'm here because I want to help.

Lightning:
I'm here because Piper forced me to be here.

Mustang:
Ha! I appreciate the honesty! Why'd our lovely Piper put ya here?

Lightning:
She said I needed to make friends. So...I guess that's what I'm doing here?

Mustang:
Well that's a tall order! But not an impossible one! 

Mustang:
Folks 'round here aren't the lonely type. We all need each other in some way.

Mustang:
So findin' someone to hang with'll be a cinch!

Mustang:
Hey, ya already got me!

Lightning:
Oh, I - uh - I do?

Mustang:
Sure thing! Anybody who can put up with my riddles is alright in my book!

End

Lightning:
I'm here because I want to help out around here.

Lightning:
It's a good enough cause. You can't get better than Ågtrying to save the EarthÅh.

Mustang:
Oh we ain't Ågtryin' Åh. We're doin' it!

Mustang:
Thanks to my tech ex-per-teese, buildin' a climate control device'll be easier than herding geese in a garden!

Lightning:
Okay, I'm just going to casually nod like I understand and move on.

Lightning:
Why do you think you'll be able to build a device that can fix everything?

Mustang:
Oh that's simple. Cuz I'm the best!

Lightning:
I see Dex has rubbed off on everyone.

Mustang:
Hah, well that's only part of it.

Mustang:
Really, it's cuz you're here and finding parts like a bee findin' pollen!

End

Lightning:
Oh...er, thanks for the compliment.

Mustang:
You're welcome! I take it you don't get 'em often?
Lightning:
No need to rub it in-

Mustang:
Nah, nah, heh, I don't mean it like that. 

Lightning:
No, yeah, I know. I just...uhm...

Lightning:
I'm not used to getting compliments from anyone other than Piper.

Mustang:
Oh, I gotcha. Well, stop by again sometime for more.

Mustang:
Although I can't guarantee they'll be untarnished by Western slang.

Lightning:
It wouldn't be you if it wasn't.
