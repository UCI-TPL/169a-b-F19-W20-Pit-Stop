Mustang:
Anything new, slick?

Lightning:
So you and Chief are good friends?

Mustang:
Oh, more 'n that! Chief is my partner in crime.

Mustang:
Why they're slicker than a linebacker slidin' down a rattlesnake farm!

Lightning:
Do you...Do you understand everything that comes out of your mouth?

Mustang:
I'll let you in on a little secret-

Mustang:
...

Mustang:
I have never understood a single word I've said in my entire dang life.

Lightning:
Brr.

Mustang:
What's that?

Lightning:
Oh, nothing. I just felt, for some reason, that a lot of people just said "same".
