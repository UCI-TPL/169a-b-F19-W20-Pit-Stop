Lightning:
GAAAAK!!!

Narrator:
(You try your wheels again, but your gas is running out.)

Lightning:
(You try your radio.)

Lightning:
GAK! DAMMIT, I KNOW YOU'RE OUT THERE!

Narrator:
(Nothing but static.)

Lightning:
...

Lightning:
Well that's just...

Lightning:
Motorific.

Lightning:
*inhales* Okay...

Lightning:
One last time.

Narrator:
(You turn your radio back on.)

Lightning:
Hey, you guys.

Lightning:
I know you're listening.

Lightning:
Chief, at least, I'm sure.

Lightning:
This is probably gonna be my last radio message 'cause-

Lightning:
I don't think I'm getting out of this.

Lightning:
So here's what I wanna say...

EndC

Choices
I'm sorry for what I did
I'm sorry for how I left

Lightning:
I'm so sorry for everything I did. 

Lightning:
I hurt all of you. And for that I really am sorry. 

Lightning:
I lied. That's all there is to it. I lied and this is the karma I get, I guess.

Lightning:
*laughs* Maybe there IS some weird car god up there.

Lightning:
If there is, they probably made the right call.

End

Lightning:
I'm sorry for the way I left.

Lightning:
You have to understand, I didn't know what else to say.

Lightning:
*laughs* Who am I kidding.

Lightning:
There was nothing I could say. All of you were right about me.

End

Lightning:
But...

EndC

Choices
I didn't mean any of it
I made a mistake

Lightning:
Please, I didn't mean ANY of it. Really. 

Lightning:
I didn't mean to push you all away by doing the things I was doing.

Lightning:
I didn't mean to treat any of you that way...

Lightning:
Or...or maybe I did, at one point. 

Lightning:
I-I don't know anymore! 

Lightning:
All I know is I didn't mean for it to end like this. 

End

Lightning:
I know now that this was all just one giant mistake.

Lightning:
Alright?

Lightning:
You got me. I'm just a big flippin' idiot. 

Lightning:
My mind was made up and I was too stupid and too stubborn to change it.

Lightning:
I made a dumb mistake because the only person I was thinking of was...

Lightning:
...myself. 

End

Lightning:
And for that...

EndC

Choices
I don't expect forgiveness
I hope you can forgive me

Lightning:
I don't expect any of you to forgive me.

Lightning:
I know that sounds, like, SUPER cheesy - 

Lightning:
But it's true.

Lightning:
There's no reason you should forgive a headstrong moron like me, so I don't want you to.

Lightning:
I just want you to hear my voice now, and know the truth.

Lightning:
Know that I listened to you. All of you.

Lightning:
And know that...it meant something to me.

End

Lightning:
I hope you guys can forgive me.

Lightning:
I just couldn't get past my own head.

Lightning:
I thought I had something to prove, somewhere to go.

Lightning:
But now I know that was just me being a headstrong moron.

Lightning:
I know you all deserve better than me, but what I want more than anything right now...

Lightning:
...is to be back with you all.

End

Lightning:
So this is me. Signing off.

Lightning:
You guys...

Lightning:
You guys were alright.

Lightning:
Well, at least the shakes are over, so maybe I can-


Lightning:
...

Lightning:
I hate myself.

Narrator:
(Suddenly, the door busts open.)

Lightning:
Mustang!?

Mustang:
Hang on, Lightning, I gotchu!

Narrator:
(Mustang's own grapples shoot out and hook onto your fender. They start to reel you in.)

Mustang:
MOVE!

Lightning:
Don't have to tell me twice!

Narrator:
(You burn up the last of your gas tank and put pedal to the metal!)

Narrator:
(Quick as lightning, Mustang pulls you out into the safety of the outside hallway. The room collapses in behind you.)

Mustang:
Hoooo WEE! That was closer than a rattlesnake in a mongoose burrow!

Lightning:
...

Mustang:
You alright there, rookie?

Lightning:
...I missed you so goddamn much you funky western motherfucker.

Piper:
LIGHTNING!!!!

$P6

Piper:
Oh thank GOODNESS you're all right! We were getting REAL scared by that last transmission.

Lightning:
So you guys were listening?

Dex:
Yes, indeed -

$D0
$P0

Dex:
"Headstrong moron".

$D5
$P5

Lightning:
Great. Can we, uh, forget all about it?

Chief:
Sorry, Lightning. That'd be against the rules. 

Springtrap:
Besides, it'll be a lot more fun to tease you this way, now that you gave us a firsthand look at your diary~.

$S2

Lightning:
Getting crushed to death is starting to sound like an appealing alternative now.

Piper:
Oh you put a brake on that!

$P4

Piper:
Do you have ANY IDEA how WORRIED I was?

$P3

Piper:
We really thought you were gonna die!

$P4

Piper:
You-You airbag!

Lightning:
Ah, bringing out the real zingers now, huh?

Piper:
Lightning-!

$P6

Lightning:
I know, I'm sorry.

Lightning:
It's how I cope. And...you guys...

Lightning:
Everything I said on that transmission was true. 

Lightning:
The Spirit is a part of me now, and-

Lightning:
!!

Lightning:
THE PARTS!

Chief:
They've probably been lost in the debris, we can't-

Lightning:
NO! Gak took them!

Dex:
Gak!? Who is-?

$D1

Lightning:
I'll explain later, right now, we have to find them before they take off! There's a rocket that's gonna leave at any second!

Chief:
Lightning, this building is too unstable. If that rocket goes off, this whole place will collapse.

Lightning:
Which is why we have to move fast.

Springtrap:
No, we can't take that kind of risk.

$S0

Piper:
We can find more parts, we can't find more you!

$P6

Lightning:
...I know. You guys don't have to stay. This is my fault anyway.

Lightning:
Get out while you can, and I can deal with Gak.

Chief:
Lightning-

$P32

Lightning:
No matter what you say, I'm doing this. So don't try talking me out of it.

Piper:
...

$P3

Piper:
Then we're staying!

$P6

Lightning:
No, you really don't have to-

Mustang:
After ALL THAT just to come get your trunk? There's no way in icy HELL we're leavin' ya now.

Dex:
'Sides, you said all we have to do is be fast right? You are speaking my language!

$D5

Lightning: 
But-

Springtrap:
Oi.

$S0

Springtrap:
YOU wanted to play the stubborn game. And you are picking the WRONG people to play with.

$S2

Chief:
Then let's hustle. Where's Gak?

$S02

Lightning:
They're probably in the center room where the rocket is, but they probably short-circuited the door to lock themselves in. Mustang?

Mustang:
I got just the thing in mind. All we're missin' are the gizmos to do it.

Lightning:
Tell me what you need and let's get those parts back.

End
