Knew you'd be back for more!

Lightning:
More what?

Dex:
More of the MASTER.

Uh huh.

Lightning:
I think I'm gonna go...-

Dex:
Hey, hey, hey! Don't be like that!

Don't you wanna see the sweet new tricks I've got? Fresh off the press!

Lightning:
Tricks? Aren't you a race car?

Dex:
Race AND trick car. Impressed?

If there's gotta be one last racing champion, it's only natural that it be the BEST of the best!

Hm. Yes.

Lightning:
Your mirrors must get plenty of work.

Lightning:
So, what, did you wake up on a race track or something?

$D0

Dex:
Oh! I'm SO glad you asked!

$D5

Lightning:
Oh no.

Dex:
I was actually one of the first to wake up!

Dex:
There was a blinding light for a split second. 

$D3

Dex:
And then, boom! I knew who I was!

$D2 

Dex:
A champion!

Dex:
I'm the only one around here with the blinding light story, so it must mean it was only for special cars. 

Dex: 
So don't feel too bad if you didn't get to see it! It just wasn't meant for you!

Lightning:
Oh phew. Yeah that's REALLY been bothering me, but you sure made me feel better.
