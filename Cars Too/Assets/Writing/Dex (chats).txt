Dex:
Knew you'd be back for more!

Lightning:
More what?

Dex:
More of the MASTER.

Lightning:
Uh huh.

Lightning:
I think I'm gonna go...-

Dex:
Hey, hey, hey! Don't be like that!

Dex:
Don't you wanna see the sweet new tricks I've got? Fresh off the press!

Lightning:
Tricks? Aren't you a race car?

Dex:
Race AND trick car. Impressed?

Dex:
Of course you are! 

Dex:
If there's gotta be one last racing champion, it's only natural that it be the BEST of the best!

Lightning:
Hm. Yes.

Lightning:
Your mirrors must get plenty of work.

Lightning:
So, what, did you wake up on a race track or something?

Dex:
Oh! I'm glad you asked!

Lightning:
Oh no.

Dex:
I was actually one of the first to wake up! 

Dex:
There was a blinding light for a split second. And then, boom! I knew who I was! 

Dex:
A champion!

Dex:
I'm the only one around here with the blinding light story, so it must mean it was only for special cars. 

Dex: 
So don't feel too bad if you didn't get to see it! It just wasn't meant for you!

Lightning:
Oh phew. I was really bummed about that for a second, but that really made me feel better.
