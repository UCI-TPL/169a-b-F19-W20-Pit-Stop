Lightning:
Springtrap, you mind if I join you on your perimeter check?

Springtrap:
Sure, why not. 

Springtrap:
Have some more questions for the security guard?

Lightning:
“Does it get boring?” is the first thing that comes to mind.

Springtrap:
Oh, yeah it gets boring up here. 

Springtrap:
Last week I timed the tumbleweeds in a race.

Lightning:
Seriously?


Springtrap:
Li'l Junie won that one, I knew he had it in ‘im. 

Lightning:
Why do you do this check anyway? What's there to look out for?

Lightning:
Aren't we the only things left?

Springtrap:
Nah, we're not sure of that. Better safe than sorry. 

Springtrap:
And anyway, I'm not usually looking out for anything living.

Springtrap:
I'm looking out in case THAT eggbeater tries anything.

Lightning:
.....The sky?

Springtrap:
Yep.

Springtrap:
It's not like we have forecasts to check, so I have to keep my eye out for storms.

Springtrap:
They can pop out of nowhere. Even before the Crash Piper says they were a problem.

Springtrap:
But it's worse than ever with the climate being like this. 

Springtrap:
Luckily, my model came with temperature gauges and a couple more measurement gadgets that helps me make sure we aren't heading towards a tornado.

Lightning:
I think we'd be able to see a tornado way beforehand-

Springtrap:
You would THINK, right? But they come up faster than you can blink.

Springtrap:
I've gotta keep one eye open until the day we finally clean up some of this mess.

Lightning:
...Hey, I got a question.
EndC

Choices
What would you rather be doing?
Do you wish you could've seen the world before the Crash?

Lightning:
If you didn't have to be looking out for storms 24/7, what would you be doing?

Springtrip:
*scoffs* That's a loaded question.

Springtrap:
But if you don't ask the good questions...then what's the point, right?

Springtrap:
So...hm. What would I do if I didn't have to make sure Dex didn't blow himself up every other day.....

Springtrap:
I guess I'd spend more time with the others.

Lightning:
Really? You?

Springtrap:
Yeah, ME. Got a problem with that?

Lightning:
No, it's just- I dunno. I thought you were more.....you know.....

Springtrap:
A lone wolf?

Lightning:
A hermit. But, sure, lone wolf if you wanna sound cool.

Springtrap:
Oh I don't need a title to “sound cool”, wise guy.

Lightning:
Now you're starting to sound like Dex.

Springtrap:
Ugh, don't even SAY that.

Springtrap:
Anyways, yeah, I would wanna spend more time with the Spirit Crew.

Lightning:
Even Dex?

Springtrap:
EVEN Dex. Sometimes I'd like to ram that smug face of his into the track dirt for all those stupid stunts he pulls but.....

Springtrap:
Now, do NOT tell him I said this-

Springtrap:
But he's a lot of fun to hang out with.

Springtrap:
SOMETIMES. Most of the time he's like a fly you can't bat away.

Springtrap:
And the others...They all have something to say.

Springtrap:
Things you don't think of, you CAN'T think of on your own, just because they're all different PEOPLE.

Springtrap:
If we're all that's left.....there's gotta be something in knowing more about each other.

Lightning:
.....Yeah. I guess there is.....

End

Lightning:
The world is...pretty messed up right now.

Springtrap:
*scoffs* Tell me somethin' I don't know.

Lightning:
Well, let me finish. I wanted to know if you would've liked to have seen what it was before.

Springtrap:
Before the Crash?

Springtrap:
That's an easy one.

Springtrap:
Nope.

Lightning:
Really? No?

Springtrap:
No way in hell. That world was filled with the people that destroyed this world in the first place.

Lightning:
Well.....that's true, but you're not even curious?

Springtrap:
Nah. Besides, then where's the fun in Piper's crazy speculations?

Springtrap:
I wouldn't wanna let her down.

Lightning:
Well, what if it was just you?

Springtrap:
*laughs* Just me? Now I REALLY wouldn't care. Although.....

Springtrap:
I guess it WOULD be pretty nice to know way more than everyone else. 

Springtrap:
Then maybe I would know what it's like to be Chief.

Springtrap:
Point is, how those humans squandered away the Earth's resources doesn't particularly interest me.

Springtrap:
It's up to us to not do the same mistakes.

Lightning:
Don't you think it's important to know what those mistakes are?

Springtrap:
Whatever they were, they were HUMAN mistakes. Not car mistakes. We're bound to do something different. To MAKE something different.

Lightning:
I don't know.....I think.....I think Piper's right.

Lightning:
We should know what they did. They made us, after all.

Lightning:
I think we should know the consequences.

End

Springtrap:
.....Really?


Lightning:
Yes? Why, something weird about-?

Springtrap:
Oh no. It's just. You've changed, ya know?

Lightning:
What do you mean?

Springtrap:
Before you really gave off a “I don't care bout no one, just doin' a dumb job.”

Lightning:
You REALLY didn't have to do a voice.

Springtrap:
But now you're.....I don't know. Not giving the same answers.

Lightning:
.....I'll be honest, I have no idea what to say to that.

Springtrap:
We'll I'm not really the car to go to for “smooth conversations”. Saunter over to Dex for that.

Springtrap:
Hey, I've got a question for YOU.

Lightning:
Oh boy.
Springtrap:
Heh, don't look so scared, it's nothing.

Springtrap:
What I wanna know is....

Springtrap:
If someone you cared about - REALLY cared about - wanted to leave, would you want them to stay or go?

Lightning:
Why are they leaving?

Springtrap:
Just cause they want to. They have something to do. They wanna move on, for whyever they like.

Springtrap:
So? What would it be?

EndC
I would want them to stay.
I would want them to go.

Lightning:
I would.....I would want them to stay.

Lightning:
Whatever reason they came up with on their own isn't good enough.

Lightning:
And anyways, even if they did have a good reason, why would they want to leave on their own?

Lightning:
It would be kinda selfish to just leave like that. 

Lightning:
I mean, if-if it's someone I REALLY care about...

Lightning:
What do you think?

Springtrap:
To be honest, I'd want them to go. 

End

Lightning:
I would want them to go.

Lightning:
It's their decision to leave, I don't think it'd be my place to keep them here.

Lightning:
If they want to leave...doesn't that mean they're not happy in the first place?

Lightning:
Why would I want them to stay?

Lightning:
That would just be...selfish of me.

Lightning:
What do you think?

Springtrap:
Yeah, that's what I'd go with too.

End

Springtrap:
But I appreciate your answer. 

Springtrap:
The fact is, no matter how hard you try...

Springtrap:
People come. People go. And at the end of the day, the choice is up to them.

Springtrap:
But it's nice to think we'll matter when decision time rolls around.

Springtrap:
It was.....nice to hang out with you again, Lightning.

Springtrap:
Let's do this again sometime.

End
