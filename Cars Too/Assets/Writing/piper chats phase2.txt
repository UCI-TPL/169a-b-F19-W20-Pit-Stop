It's mooootorific!

Lightning:
Piper, I thought you were all about "being good" and whatever.

Lightning:
Now you wanna gossip?

Piper:
Okay, okay, I lied. It's not REALLY a secret.

$P5

Piper:
I just thought you outta know a little somethin' about Springtrap!

$P0

Piper:
I know she's a bit difficult to get to know, but if you find any spiked wheels lying around-

Piper:
Well, she just loves those things!

$P2

Piper:
Try giving one to her, and you'll see.

Hey, that's the spirit!

I knew you were still a bit of a rebel engine.

$P5

Lightning:
Alright, alright.

Lightning:
What's this secret you have?

Piper:
Oh, uh, actually I lied.

It's not REALLY a secret.

How did you get to know the Spirit Crew, Piper?

Piper:
Oh! Long story!

$P2

Piper:
After we woke up together and you decided to head into the desert...

$P0

Piper:
I decided to head into the city!

Piper:
Which...didn't end up being as wheeltastic as I thought, heh.

$P5

Piper:
I ended up getting myself stuck in a pothole.

$P4

Piper:
But that was where Springtrap found me and brought me to the crew!

$P2

Piper:
Oh, hm, I guess it's not actually that long of a story.

$P5

Lightning:
Oh, Springtrap found you, huh?

Piper:
Yep! And we've been besties ever since!

$P2

Piper:
Well, maybe it was a little one-sided at first.

$P5

Piper:
But she rolled around!

$P0

Piper:
Just like you!

$P2

Lightning:
Me?

Piper:
Yeah! You were so shut-in at first but now...

$P0

Piper:
Look at you!

Piper:
Chatting with everyone, having a great time!

$P2

Piper:
It's so motorific, don't you think?

$P0

Lightning:
Y-Yeah...I guess...
