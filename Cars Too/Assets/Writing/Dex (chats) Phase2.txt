This factory is amazing right?

Dex:
I am already planning on starting a new circuit here.

Lightning:
You really are quite the racer aren't you?

Dex:
Before I met the Spirit, racing was my full time thing. I really miss those days.

Lightning:
One of these days, you and I will have to race.

Dex:
As you if you have a chance.

Have you been exploring the factory?

I definitely went over the 50 feet limit.

Dex:
