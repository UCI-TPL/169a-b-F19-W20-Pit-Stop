Piper:
Lightning!

Lightning:
Oh, hey, Piper! Something wrong?

Piper:
Nope, just wanted to check on you. How're you doing?

Lightning:
Oh. Well, I just got 4 parts and now I'm on my-

Piper:
I didn't mean like that! I mean how are you getting on with everyone?

$P2

Lightning:
Oh. Fine, I guess?

Piper:
You guess?

$P5

Lightning:
Look, I'm just working on getting these parts, I'm not really-

Piper:
Oh, come on. You promised me you'd talk to people. 

$P3

Piper:
So how is everyone?

$P2

Lightning:
They're all...fine? I'll be honest, everyone here seems a tiiiny bit crazy in one way or another.

Piper:
Hah, we wouldn't be a family if we weren't.

$P5

Mustang:
Howdy slick! 

$P02

Lightning:
Mustang? What're you-?

Mustang:
Just made some real progress on the device schematics. 

Mustang:
Figured I'd fill you in since you're the one pickin' up more parts than a scrapper in a junkyard. 

Piper:
Oh, what're the updates?

Mustang:
Well, I've got good news 'n' bad news.

Mustang:
The good news is - thanks to the whiz kid over here - we're basically done with the original device.

Piper:
Uhm, I don't like how you just referred to the device as “the original”. 

$P3

Mustang:
Well, there's the bad news. Since drawin' up our original blueprints, Big Bad Mr. Climate's gotten mad as a march hare. 

Mustang:
Thanks to those humans handin' down THEIR debt to pay, we're gonna need even more parts if we wanna keep that hornet from stingin' us back.

Piper:
I see.

Lightning:
You understood all that?

Piper:
Nope, but I got that we definitely need more parts overall, right?

$P2

Mustang:
You betcha. And fast.

Piper:
Right. Looks like we've gotta pick up the pace.

$P0

Mustang:
'Course, we wouldn't NEED to do anything if the humans hadn't mucked it up in the first place...

$P32

Piper:
Oh, Mustang I wish you'd quit putting so much blame on them.

Mustang:
Oh? Ya think? So tell me where that blame falls then, hm?

Mustang:
Cuz I know it sure as rain ain't any of us.

Mustang:
Unless you figured out how to do decades of climate damage while I had my back turned.

Piper:
No, Mustang, I know it wasn't any of us but-

Mustang:
Good! Glad you agree. Now maybe you'll stop siftin' through their garbage.

Piper:
Hey! It isn't GARBAGE! You're getting all your tools from them!

$P6

Mustang:
Oh, that's right. Just cuz I have to USE their junk to fix THEIR problem, I should be thanking them, right?

Piper:
That's not what I-

Mustang:
Ya think they're so much better than what they really are, Piper.

Mustang:
But, ya GOTTA face it. You're panning for gold in SEWAGE.

$P32

Piper:
...

$P4

Lightning:
Er, Mustang, maybe you should-

Piper:
I'm tired of it.

Mustang:
Pardon?

Piper:
I'm tired of you being so MEAN with them all the time!

$P6

Mustang:
O-hoh! If you think THAT'S mean-!

Piper:
Hey! No! 

Piper:
You let me finish, Mustang. 

$P7

Piper:
I'm standing my ground this time.

Piper:
Because I've had enough of your constant bullying.

Piper:
Look around you!

$P6

Piper:
What's the point of nagging about people who are DEAD?

Piper:
Do you think they wanted this? 

Piper:
Do you honestly believe every single human deserved to die?

$P3

Mustang:
Do YOU honestly believe those SCUM shouldn't a' cleaned up their OWN MESS?

Piper:
You didn't answer my question!

$P6

Mustang:
'N' you didn't answer mine!

Piper:
Answer mine first.

$P7

Mustang:
Oh, we don't have time fer this! Didn' you hear me earlier about beatin' the clock?

Piper:
You always do this! You always dodge the question! 

$P6

Piper:
You avoid going any deeper than "Everything's the humans fault, humans are the Devil 'n' lazier than a tired old dog sittin' in a sunbeam."

$P4

Mustang:
FIRST of all -

$P32

Mustang:
 - that was surprisingly an ace-high impression, missy -

Piper:
Thank you, I've been working on it.

Mustang:
SECOND of all -

Mustang:
That's because I don't NEED to go any deeper. We already know all we need to condemn those lazy vermin.

Piper:
You're calling the HUMANS lazy, when you won't even give them at least a second look?

$P6

Mustang:
Oh I've given them a second look!

$P32

Mustang:
And a third, and a fourth, and every single time, it ends with a custom climate DISASTER and a sign o'er their heads spellin' out "GUILTY" in neon letters!

$P42

Mustang:
You're right, Piper! They're all gone, and they can't do nothin' 'bout the past.

Mustang:
But if you think for a second that I'll forgive 'em just 'cause they're pushin' up daisies -

Mustang:
Then we really got our wires crossed here. 

Piper:
...

Piper:
What do you think, Lightning?

$P3

Lightning:
What?

Piper:
I want to know...if you agree with what Mustang's saying.

Piper:
So what do you think?

Narrator:
(Mustang and Piper both look to you in curious anticipation.)

Take Piper's side
Take Mustang's side

Lightning:
I-...I think you're right, Piper.

Piper:
Phew!

$P5

Piper:
See, Mustang! Even Lightning agrees with me, you shouldn't be so-!

$P0

Lightning:
But, Piper...

Piper:
Yes?

Lightning:
I also think you're jumping to conclusions. 

Piper:
!?

$P1

Lightning:
You should hear what Mustang has to say. They know more th -

Piper:
I've heard all I need to-!

$P7

Piper:
...

$P4

Piper:
Oh. Yeah, I hear it now.

$P3

Lightning:
Look, Piper, I think it's pretty cool of you to jump in to defend people like that.

Lightning:
I mean, since these people in particular can't defend themselves and all...

Lightning:
But that doesn't mean you can just assume people's intentions.

Lightning:
'Sides...I know you're better than that.

Piper:
Aw, Lightning...

$P5

Piper:
You're right! I am better than this! 

$P2

Piper:
Mustang, I owe you an apology.

$P0

Piper:
I didn't mean to shut your opinions out like that.

$P3

Piper:
They just made me mad! So I'd hear the first sentence...and then I wouldn't want to listen anymore.

$P4

Piper:
But now...I'd like to know.

$P3

Piper:
Why are you so mad at all of them?

Piper:
You know as well as I do that it's just not possible for every human to have been in on it.

Piper:
You KNOW they couldn't have wanted this.

Piper:
So...why don't you give them a REAL closer look? One that's not just another hateful glance.

Mustang:
...

Piper:
I-If you don't mind telling me.

$P4

Mustang:
...

Mustang:
No.

Mustang:
No, I don't mind.

$P02

Mustang:
The truth is, Piper-

$P32

Mustang:
It's not that I hate every single one of 'em.

Mustang:
It's that I don't want THEM to go on haunting us.

Mustang:
Especially you.

Piper:
??

$P1

Piper:
I-I don't understand. What do you mean?

Mustang:
You spend every single day siftin' through their garb-

$P32

Mustang:
Er...their PAST...

Mustang:
And with every single little trinket, or artifact, or whatever you find, you come up with some great purpose it must've had.

Mustang:
You never acknowledge the corn and just admit some things were just MUNDANE.

Mustang:
Sometimes a stick is just a stick, and you don't gotta give it a purpose.

Mustang:
I don't want you givin' 'em glory they don't deserve.

Mustang:
I respect your passion for history.

Mustang:
But you gotta face the facts sometimes and drop the optimism for realism.

Mustang:
They weren't all perfect and innocent-

Piper:
I know that!

$P6

Piper:
I know that, Mustang.

$P3

Piper:
I know not every human was perfect. I-If they were...you're right.

$P4

Piper:
We probably wouldn't be in this mess.

Piper:
I just...wanted to find the good in them.

Piper:
I know there were good ones, there HAD to be!

$P6

Piper:
I just thought maybe I could honor them by finding that good in whatever I could find.

$P0

Piper:
I didn't realize - to you - I was...making them ALL look "perfect and innocent".

$P3

Piper:
But, really, that wasn't my intention.

Piper:
I just...don't want the humans who made the right differences...to be forgotten. 

Piper:
Like the ones who made us! 

$P2

Piper:
I think we're here for a reason. They knew we could change things!

$P0

Piper:
I don't want to glorify the bad ones, Mustang.

$P4

Piper:
But I can't give up on all of them just because they're not here now.

$P3

Piper:
I'm happy you respect my passion, Mustang. But I need you to respect them too.

Piper:
A-And I'm not asking for forgiveness. Or pity or mercy or anything like that.

$P4

Piper:
I'm asking you to treat them like we treat each other. Like sentient beings.

$P3

Piper:
They all had personalities and feelings. And lives.

$P0

Piper:
So they ALL deserve our consideration.

$P5

Piper:
This planet is their tomb. Not their waste basket. 

$P3

Piper:
They were people, Mustang. I don't want you to treat them like the relics they left behind.

Mustang:
...

Piper:
Can you promise me that? 

Mustang:
Look, they may've been sentient, but the things they did-

Piper:
That SOME of them did. 

$P6

Piper:
And besides, it's not like we have proof the same thing won't happen to us.

$P5

Piper:
If we want to truly be better than them, we have to at least try to understand who they were.

$P3

Piper:
So will you try?

Mustang:
...

Mustang:
I'll be honest. I can't promise anything...

Piper:
You don't have to promise results! You just have to promise effort.

Piper:
Please?

Mustang:
...

Mustang:
I...uh...

Mustang:
Ah, I never was any good at bein' saccharine with HUMANS.

Piper:
*laughs* Tell me something I don't know!

$P2

Mustang:
Yeah, well...here goes -

$P02

Mustang:
I'm glad you let me have the simon-pure. 

Mustang:
I'll stop making TOO many jabs at those meat bags-

Piper:
Come again?

$P7

Mustang:
Er...those PEOPLE. 

$P52

Mustang:
But I can't change in a day!

Piper:
Neither can I! But I'll try anyway.

$P0

Mustang:
And so will I.

Piper:
And, Lightning.

Piper:
Thank you for believing in me back there.

Piper:
It means a lot that you had my back, even when I was...acting up, I guess.

$P5

Lightning:
Anytime, Pipes.

End

Lightning:
I-....I think I have to side with Mustang on this one.

$P6

Mustang:
Aha! See, lamb chop! Rookie's still got SOME brains under that hood-

$P42

Lightning:
BUT, I think you're being shallow here, Mustang.

Mustang:
'Scuse me??

$P52

Lightning:
Look, you're right. Humans OBVIOUSLY messed up this planet, not us. 

Lightning:
But what are you gaining by turning on Piper like this?

Lightning:
You're not even letting her explain why she does what she does. 

Mustang:
...

$P32

Lightning:
She has more to say than just "Humans are motorific!" and you're not giving her enough credit there.

Lightning:
And...And I know you're better than that.

Lightning:
I know you might not care about humans...but I know you care about us.

Mustang:
...

$P52

Narrator:
(Piper looks to Mustang, with a genuinely curious glint in her eye.)

Narrator:
(Mustang sinks just a little, as if they have resigned to something.)

Mustang:
...You ain't wrong slick.

Mustang:
And I'm not about to let my hatred for those meat bags get in the way of what really matters.

Mustang:
Piper, I owe you an apology.

$P02

Mustang:
I was so caught up in gettin' you to see how horrible those good-for-nothin's were, that I didn't even see I was hurting you.

Mustang:
The truth is, I just didn't want you to GLORIFY those skeletons. I don't think they deserve your forgiveness.

Mustang:
So...it's okay for you to tell me what's really on your mind about 'em.

Piper:
R-Really? But you always peel out when I talk about the humans?

$P1

Mustang:
Yeah, well, this time consider my radio off 'n' my mic on.

Piper:
...

Mustang:
Well?

Piper:
S-Sorry, I'm just a little scrambled here. You've never, er, stayed this long.

$P5

Piper:
And you won't insult them while I talk? Because if you just make fun of them the whole time then there's really no point in-

$P3

Mustang:
Piper, I swear on my workshop.

Mustang:
You're good to go.

$P02 

Piper:
Okay, well, first of all, I want you to understand that...

$P3

Piper:
I know not every human was perfect. I-If they were...you're right.

$P4

Piper:
We probably wouldn't be in this mess.

Piper:
I just...wanted to find the good in them.

Piper:
You might think it's stupid to “pan for gold in sewage” but the truth is, I KNOW there's gold in there.

Piper:
I know there were good ones, there HAD to be!

$P6

Piper:
I just thought maybe I could honor them by finding that good in whatever I could find.

$P0

Piper:
I didn't realize - to you - I was...making them ALL look "perfect and innocent".

But, really, that wasn't my intention.

Mustang:
Sometimes, I could use someone to pull in my horns. It means a lot.

Lightning:
Anytime, Mustang.
