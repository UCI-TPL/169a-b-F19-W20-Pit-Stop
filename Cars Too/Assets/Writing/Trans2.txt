Chief:
Got all the parts you could find?

Lightning:
Yea.

Chief:
You're gettin' good at this. At this rate, we'll have enough parts for the purifier in a flash. 

Chief:
Next time we'll have to time you, eh?

Lightning:
M-Maybe. Yeah, sure.

Chief:
?

Chief:
You okay there?

Lightning:
Yeah I'm fine. I just. Uhm. I need to...take care of something. I'll see you around, Chief.

Chief:
Alright. But we're gonna be moving on from this place soon, so keep your radio on. Don't wanna miss us.

Lightning:
R-Right-


Lightning:
...

Piper:
Hey!

$P0

Lightning:
Oh! Uh, hey, Piper.

Piper:
How's it going? Ready for the move?

Lightning:
Yeah. Uh. About that...

Piper:
What's the matter? 

$P1

Lightning:
It's about the parts-

Piper:
Oh yeah! You turned them in to Chief, right?

$P2

Lightning:
...

Piper:
...Right?

$P0

Lightning:
Piper, I...

Piper:
You still have them!?

$P6

Piper:
Lightning, you're not actually...?

Piper:
I mean, you can't still be planning on using them for yourself?

Lightning:
...I-

Piper:
Oh my gears. 

$P3

Piper:
You were!? Really?

$P6

Piper:
Even after meeting with everyone? Even after hanging out and talking and-and-

Piper:
And being our friend?

$P3

Lightning:
...

Piper:
That was all just a lie then, I guess. 

Piper:
Even after every hangout or-or chat, you still went looking for your stupid parts, didn't you?

$P4

Lightning:
Piper-

Piper:
DON'T!

$P7

Piper:
Don't say anything. I-I need to process this. I mean-

$P3

Piper:
NOTHING mattered!? Really!? Nothing was enough for you?

$P6

Piper:
We weren't enough?

$P3

Piper:
I mean, I guess not, because you just kept working on your-your dumb plan! 

$P7

Piper:
Sure, I knew that from the beginning, I knew what your plan was, I agreed to it and everything.

$P3

Piper:
But, I never thought you'd...you'd really just stay that way. 

Piper:
You even kept up friendly conversations with all of us! But you weren't being friendly at all, were you? 

$P4

Springtrap:
Yo, Piper! I wanted to ask if-

$S0

Piper:
You just wanted faster ways to get your parts! That's all! You just USED us, didn't you?

$P7

Springtrap:
!?

$S1

Narrator:
(Piper sees Springtrap)

Piper:
Springtrap...!

$P6

Springtrap:
...

$S1

Springtrap:
Lightning. You...

$S0

Springtrap:
WHAT!?

$S6

Piper:
Uh oh.

$P3

Springtrap:
YOU WERE JUST *USING* US? Is THAT what I just heard!?

$S6

Piper:
W-Wait, Springtrap, I can explain-

$P6

Springtrap:
NO, Piper. This piece of scrap metal isn't worth your defense. 

$S7
$P4

Springtrap:
I knew something was up the MOMENT I saw you.

$S7

Springtrap:
Well, Lightning? We were just parts to you, huh?

Springtrap:
Fitting!

$S2

Springtrap:
Cuz once I'M through with you, that's all you'll be too.

$S6

Piper:
Stop, Springtrap!

$P6

Mustang:
What in tarnation is goin' on here!?

Springtrap:
Don't try to stop me! This JUNKER is going straight to the scrapyard.

$S7

Dex:
Hey hey hey! Chillax, Springtrap, what did Lightning ever do to you?

$D6

Springtrap:
Ohoh, the list is getting longer every SECOND.

$S6

Dex:
What are you talking about?

$D1

Springtrap:
Lightning's a TRAITOR. That's what I'm talking about. 

$S6

Springtrap:
You're here to get parts for YOURSELF, you low-riding lowlife.

$S7

Springtrap:
You were probably planning on skipping town too, weren't you?

Springtrap:
We'd all move next morning, and you'd be gone, with as many parts as you felt like taking, you little THIEF-

Chief:
Now that's enough!

Chief:
Someone wanna tell me why Springtrap wants to rip out Lightning's engine?

Piper:
It's my fault, Chief!

$P6

Springtrap:
Piper-!

$S3

Piper:
Please don't blame Lightning, this is my fault, I'm the one who should be punished!

$P6

Chief:
Hang on now, no one is punishing anyone. We're just confused is all.

Chief:
Just tell us what's going on.

Piper:
*sighs* Okay.

$P3

Piper:
I told Lightning they could have the parts we find. 

Piper:
On the condition….that they at least talk to everyone in Spirit.

Piper:
I just wanted them to make friends! And they did! Or at least...

$P4

Piper:
Or at least I thought they did...

Piper:
Did you, Lightning?

$P3

Lightning:
...

Mustang:
Well, slick? What'd ya got to say?

Lightning:
I...

Dex:
Lightning?

$D4

Chief:
Lightning.

Narrator:
(Chief saunters back over to the Spirit's trailer, the main storage unit.)

Piper:
Chief, where are you going?

$P1

Narrator:
(Chief returns with a box.)

Springtrap:
Our parts! 

$S3

Springtrap:
Chief, you're not-!?

$S1

Narrator:
(Chief holds the box out to you.)

Chief:
If all you wanted was the parts, then take them.
