Chief:
Got all the parts you could find?

Lightning:
Yes sir.

Chief:
You're gettin' good at this. At this rate, we'll have enough parts for the purifier in a flash. 

Chief:
Next time we'll have to time you, eh?

Lightning:
M-Maybe. Yeah, sure.

Chief:
?

Chief:
You okay there?

Lightning:
Yeah I'm fine. I just. Uhm. I need to...take care of something. I'll see you around, Chief.

Chief:
Alright. But we're gonna be moving on from this place soon, so keep your radio on. Don't wanna miss us.

Lightning:
R-Right-

Piper:
Hey!

Lightning:
Oh! Uh, hey, Piper.

Piper:
How's it going? Ready for the move?

Lightning:
Yeah. Uh. About that ...

Piper:
What's the matter? 

Lightning:
It's about the parts-

Piper:
Oh yeah! You turned them in to Chief, right?

Lightning:
...

Piper:
...Right?

Lightning:
Piper, I....

Piper:
You still have them!?

Piper:
Lightning, you're not actually....?

Piper:
I mean, you can't still be planning on using them for yourself?

Lightning:
.....I-

Piper:
Oh my gears. 

Piper:
You were!? Really?

Piper:
Even after meeting with everyone? Even after hanging out and talking and-and-

Piper:
And being our friend?

Piper:
That was all just a lie then, I guess. 

Piper:
Even after every hangout or-or chat, you still went looking for your stupid parts, didn't you?

Lightning:
Piper-

Piper:
DON'T!

Piper:
Don't say anything. I-I need to process this. I mean-

Piper:
NOTHING mattered!? Really!? Nothing was enough for you?

Piper:
We weren't enough?

Piper:
I mean, I guess not, because you just kept working on your dumb rocket...
Piper:
Sure, I knew that from the beginning, I knew what you're plan was, I agreed to it and everything, but, I never thought you'd...you'd really just stay that way. 

Piper:
You even kept up friendly conversations with all of us! But you weren't being friendly at all, were you? 

Springtrap:
Piper! I wanted to ask if-

Piper:
You just wanted faster ways to get your parts! That's all! You just USED us, didn't you?

Springtrap:
!?

Narrator:
*Piper sees Springtrap*

Piper:
Springtrap....!

Springtrap:
....

Springtrap:
Lightning. You....

Springtrap:
WHAT!?

Piper:
Uh oh.

Springtrap:
YOU WERE JUST *USING* US? Is THAT what I just heard!?

Piper:
W-Wait, Springtrap, I can explain-

Springtrap:
NO, Piper. This metal scrap isn't worth your defense. 

Springtrap:
Well, Lightning? We were just parts to you, huh?

Springtrap:
Once I'M through with you, that's all you'll be too.

Piper:
Stop, Springtrap!

Mustang:
What in tarnation is goin' on here!?

Springtrap:
Don't try to stop me! This piece of junk is going straight to the scrapyard.

Dex:
Hey hey hey! Chillax, Springtrap, what did Lightning ever do to you?

Springtrap:
Ohoh, the list is getting longer every SECOND.

Dex:
What are you talking about?

Springtrap:
Lightning's a TRAITOR. That's what I'm talking about. 

Springtrap:
You're here to get parts for yourself and that's all.

Springtrap:
You were probably planning on skipping town too, weren't you?

Springtrap:
We'd all move next morning, and you'd be gone, with as many parts as you felt like taking, you little THIEF-

Chief:
Now that's enough!

Chief:
Someone wanna tell me why Springtrap wants to rip out Lightning's engine?

Piper:
It's my fault, Chief!

Springtrap:
Piper-!

Piper:
Please don't blame Lightning, this is my fault, I'm the one who should be punished!

Chief:
Hang on now, no one is punishing anyone. We're just confused is all.

Chief:
Just tell us what's going on.

Piper:
*sighs* Okay.

Piper:
I told Lightning they could have the parts we find. 

Piper:
On the condition....that they at least talk to everyone in Spirit.

Piper:
I just wanted them to make friends! And they did! Or at least....

Piper:
Or at least I thought they did....

Piper:
Did you, Lightning?

Lightning:
.....

Mustang:
Well, slick? What'd ya got to say?

Lightning:
I....

Dex:
Lightning?

Chief:
Lightning.

Narrator:
*Chief moves back to the Spirit's trailer*

Piper:
Chief, where are you going?

Narrator:
*Chief returns with a box*

Springtrap:
Our parts! Chief, you're not-!?

Narrator:
*Chief holds the box out to you*

Chief:
If all you wanted was the parts, then take them.
