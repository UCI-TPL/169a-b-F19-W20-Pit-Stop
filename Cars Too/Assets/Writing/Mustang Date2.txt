Lightning:
Hey Mustang!

Mustang:
Something the matter?

Lightning:
Nah, I'm just...comin' back for those compliments.

Mustang:
Hah! I knew you'd be crawling back faster than a lizard to a watering hole.

Lightning:
Okay, seriously, sometimes I can totally understand.

Lightning:
And sometimes all I hear is utter NONSENSE.

Mustang:
Well, not much I can do ya for in that department. 

Mustang:
Not even I understand half of what this transmitter spits out.

Mustang:
But ya know, in a weird way, I think it's pretty fun to speak that way sometimes.

Mustang:
I ain't got the faintest idea what a watering hole is -

Mustang:
But it sure is fun to pretend you do.

Lightning:
Heh, I guess I can see that?

Lightning:
Any other riddles up your sleeve today?

Mustang:
Oh, hey yea! 

Mustang:
An ACTUAL riddle, too!

Lightning:
Oh, not one that's just Ågyour hatÅh? 

Lightning:
Bummer. I was looking forward to winning a round.

Mustang:
Well you're outta luck. Here's what we got for you today-!

Mustang:
Peaks of metal
Glass of ice

Mustang:
I wander with my heart at night

Mustang:
To deter that blazing gaze
And stroll inside this moonlit maze

Mustang:
...

Lightning:
...Wait, that's it?

Mustang:
That's it. 

Mustang:
Listen, there's somethin' you should know about me.

Mustang:
Me Åen' humans are oil on water.

Mustang:
I detest those planet-killing no-goods.

Mustang:
But the other day, I found this poem, and well-

Lightning:
You thought it was good?

Mustang:
Now don't go tellin' everyone I'm goin' soft on Åeem, I STILL hate Åeem, but-

Mustang:
Well, those words go down pretty smoothly, don'tcha think?

Lightning:
It is pretty nice. I don't know if it's a riddle, though. 

Mustang:
Yeaaaah, it don't got a fun ÅgWhat am I?Åh at the bottom but-

Mustang:
I dunno, it still makes me ask the question somehow.

Mustang:
Weird huh?

EndC

Choices
Pretty weird
Not at all

Lightning:
Yeah, pretty weird. 

Lightning:
Then again, it IS a human artifact.

Lightning:
Maybe Piper can give you a better answer?

End

Lightning:
Not at all, I think that's pretty cool.

Mustang:
Yeah, me too, pardner.

Lightning:
And if you wanna know more about it, you can probably ask Piper-

End

Mustang:
Oh no thanks there, scout.

Lightning:
Why not?

Mustang:
Nothin' it's just...

Mustang:
Me Åen' Piper ain't exactly peas in a pod.

Mustang:
We got two pretty different views when it comes to humans.

Mustang:
So to speak.

Lightning:
Oh. Well...

EndC

Choices
Is there someone in particular you like to hang out with?
What's up with humans?

Mustang:
Well, if I had to choose, it'd probably be Chief.

Mustang:
They're patient, resourceful, admirable, and most importantly-

Mustang:
Most fun to tease.

Lightning:
You TEASE Chief?

Mustang:
Absolutely. You should try it sometime!

Mustang:
It is the darnedest thing to see them get all flustered, hah!

Lightning:
No way. Remind me to try that out sometime.

Mustang:
Hehe, no problem!

End

Mustang:
What's up with humans? What ISN'T up with humans!?

Mustang:
As the former residents of this here rock, it's hard to NOT have an opinion on Åeem.

Mustang:
To me, they're a bunch of irresponsible ingrates forkin' over THEIR mess for US to clean up!

Mustang:
Everytime I have to work on that weather machine of ours, I'm reminded of those selfish snakes.

Mustang:
How long ago did they all blow to kingdom come, and we STILL got some of their problems?

Lightning:
I see what you mean. 

End

Lightning:
So, you've been around for a while now, right?

Mustang:
Long enough to figure out most of this big blue planet's gizmos.

Lightning:
But...you don't know what happened?

Lightning:
The Crash?

Mustang:
Oh, right.

Mustang:
Nope, I got nothin'. By the time I Awakened, it was ashes to ashes and dust to dust.

Lightning:
Still, you must know more than some of us.

EndC

Choices
How do you think the apocalypse went down?
Any theories on what we are?

Mustang:
Like I said, I wasn't-

Lightning:
But what do you THINK happened?

Lightning:
Sure, we all know there was some big explosion or something that wiped everyone out almost instantly-

Lightning:
But we still have no idea what caused it or why. Any theories?


Mustang:
Hmmm, well...

Mustang:
To be honest, I think this is more up Piper's alley, but uh-

Mustang:
My guess is there was a storm.

Mustang:
Based on how kooky the weather can get sometimes now, and how high the flood levels got-

Mustang:
There could've been a huge, possibly volcanic storm.

Mustang:
A storm so hot and powerful that it dried everything up.

Lightning:
Well, clearly not everything. After all, the ocean is still huge.

Mustang:
It wasn't always though. 

Mustang:
From my scans, it's lookin' like there're a LOT of human relics at the bottom of the sea.

Mustang:
And when I say a lot, I mean CITIES worth. 

Mustang:
There might've been huge blocks of ice in the ocean that melted down when the storm came.

Mustang:
And washed away everything.

Lightning:
That sounds ridiculous, though. A storm? Out of nowhere?

Mustang:
Well, it might not've been au natural. 

Mustang:
If I can make a device that fixes up the weather...

Mustang:
The humans could probably make a device that tears it apart. 

End

Mustang:
Oh I've got a good one!

Lightning:
Really!?

Mustang:
Cars!

Lightning:
....

Mustang:
....

Lightning:
....I don't know WHY I didn't think you'd go for the low-hanging fruit.
Mustang:
Then you think much MUCH too highly of me, stranger. 

Lightning:
Do you have a less tease-y answer?

Mustang:
Er, well, let's see.

Mustang:
We're definitely sentient-

Mustang:
-but we can't leave our cars.

Mustang:
Technically-speaking, we AREN'T the car-

Mustang:
And yet...we are...

Mustang:
Oho! Look at me, makin' up more riddles!

Lightning:
More riddles you don't have the answer to?

Mustang:
Yyyes and no...

Mustang:
My theory is that we are AI, artificial intelligence, built into the car to help it run.

Mustang:
But I don't really see how Chief and the other's having those human-looking avatars help us any.

Mustang:
We must'a been made by humans, otherwise they wouldn't be reflecting their image.

Mustang:
But that's about all I got there. 

Mustang:
How Åebout you? Got any theories of your own?

Lightning:
I never really thought about it. Until now, I guess.

Lightning:
I don't really use my avatar.

End

Lightning:
So then...given everything that's happened...

Lightning:
What do you think of this world now?

Mustang:
How do ya mean?

Lightning:
I mean...

EndC

Choices
Do you really think we can fix things?
Have you ever thought about leaving?

Lightning:
Do you really think we can fix things?

Lightning:
Like your device...think we can undo all of it?

Mustang:
Don't have faith in me?


Lightning:
No, no it's not that...

Lightning:
It's just....
Lightning:
Even if you're able to fix it with the parts we found, it would only help reverse the weather, right?

Lightning:
It would slowly fix the climate. But, it wouldn't fix the terrain. Or the ocean.

Mustang:
Well, it's not about that, Lightning.

Mustang:
It's not like I'm slappin' together a time machine here.

Mustang:
Things Åeround here ain't EVER gonna be the way they used to be.

Mustang:
And that's the way it's meant to be. 

End

Lightning:
Have you ever thought about leaving?

Mustang:
Leavin'?

Mustang:
*laughs* Leavin' where? 

Mustang:
We're just a dirt pile in the middle of blue. 

Mustang:
Sorta difficult to escape a climate disaster, don'tcha think?

Lightning:
Well, I was sort of thinking...not on this planet anymore.

Lightning:
I think we can all agree things down here aren't looking pretty.

Lightning:
So...what if you could...I dunno...
Lightning:
Take off?

Lightning:
You're the tech geek, right? Surely you've thought of building like a rocket or something-

Mustang:
Nope! That'd be a first for me.

Lightning:
Seriously?


Mustang:
Yup.

End

Mustang:
Listen, when you're down here long enough, and when you've seen the things I have-

Mustang:
This rock becomes your home. 

Mustang:
Yeah, I'm not too keen on fixing a problem that ain't mine to begin with -

Mustang:
And yeah, I could do without the constant reminders of humans-

Mustang:
But they ain't here no more.

Mustang:
This ain't their planet.

Mustang:
And I think it's worth making it ours.

Mustang:
Don't you?

Lightning:
It's...something to think about.
