Piper:
Now that you can check the new place out, we can start finding more-

Piper:
...Uh oh.

Lightning:
What's-

Springtrap:
I DON'T CARE! I'm TELLING you that it IS - NOT - SAFE!

Lightning:
Oh.

Piper:
Springtrap and Dex are at it again.

Dex:
And I'm telling YOU you have no sense of adventure! We won't get anywhere if we don't try!

Piper:
Don't worry, they'll probably burn themselves out soon enough. 

Piper:
I'll go help Mustang with his stuff.

Springtrap:
Dex, we've been over this. I'm security, right?

Dex:
Yes, but-

Springtrap:
RIGHT?

Dex:
...right.

Springtrap:
SO, if you want your WHEELS to stay on your BODY, you'll listen to me when I say -

Springtrap:
DO NOT TRY THAT JUMP.

Dex:
You know, Springtrap, you can quit that lying.

Springtrap:
ExCUSE ME?

Dex:
*laughs* You don't care about my ÅgsafetyÅh!

Dex:
You just don't like the fact that I'm better than you.

Springtrap:
WHAT!?

Dex:
It's obvious you would like nothing better than for me to Ågknow my placeÅh because you're afraid I'll take yours.

Springtrap:
Ooooo- that DOES IT!

Springtrap:
Let me make this PERFECTLY - CRYSTAL for you.

Springtrap:
I couldn't care LESS about some stupid hierarchy you built up in that bratty little head of yours.

Springtrap:
NONE of us are better than each other, esPECIALLY not YOU.

Dex:
That's not true. Chief is looking out for all of us, they-

Springtrap:
Oh don't you dare bring up Chief now, Dex. They aren't better than us either!

Dex:
How can you say that after everything they've done for us? We wouldn't be here if it weren't for them-
Springtrap:
Why do you keep acting like you're indebted to them!? Like something will go wrong if you don't do what Chief says?

Dex:
They KNOW what to do, Springtrap. Why can't YOU have any sense of authority?

Springtrap:
Because I, for one, care if someone's walking all over me.

Dex:
I do NOT let people walk-

Springtrap
How would you even know!? You're so self-absorbed, I'd bet anything that you can't see past your own windshield. 

Dex:
At least I HAVE confidence! You're too scared to drive over GRAVEL, let alone actually get somewhere meaningful.

Dex:
If YOU were leading this crew, we would've already been broken down in a ditch somewhere because you were too afraid to crawl out of it.

Springtrap:
Are you KIDDING me!? If YOU were leading this crew, we would've EXPLODED somewhere because you can't tell the difference between propane and gasoline!

Springtrap:
You're SO bent on being this GREAT leader to fill in for Chief, but you just AREN'T.

Springtrap:
And you'll NEVER be!

Springtrap:
I don't know why you even try-!

Narrator:
Springtrap pauses in horror as she realizes her mistake. She's gone too far.

Narrator:
Dex looks devastated. Both of them are at a loss for words. 
Narrator:
Dex spins on his wheels and takes off. Springtrap remains, still angry but silent.

Comfort Dex
Stay with Springtrap

Lightning:
Dex!

Narrator:
Considering his speed, it takes a little longer than expected to catch up with Dex. 

Narrator:
In the end, you find him secluded and alone.

Dex:
Ah, Lightning! I'm sorry you had to be there for-

Dex:
*sniff*

Lightning:
?? A-Are you-!?

Dex:
NO!

Dex:
I've just got a bit of oil leakage that's all. It'll fix itself in just a moment.

Dex:
Did you need something?

Lightning:
Well, yeah. I wanted to see how you were doing. 

Lightning:
And I'm guessing your biggest trouble right now isn't really maintenance.

Dex:
No, hah, I suppose it's pretty obvious.

Lightning:
Listen...I haven't known you all for very long but...I know Springtrap didn't really mean what she said to you.

Dex:
Oh really? Because it seems perfectly natural to me. 

Dex:
She always does this. Always makes me seem like I'm a simple child.

Lightning:
Well...uh...maybe you are.

Dex:
What!?

Lightning:
I-I mean, don't take that the wrong way-

Dex:
*laughs* How else am I supposed to take it?

Lightning:
I-...*sigh* Let me explain.

Lightning:
The way it looks to me - at least after that big blow-up - is that Springtrap really cares about you.

Dex:
Pardon? Uh, were you even there for that?

Lightning:
Yeah, I was. And I also saw that jump you were attempting.

Dex:
Oh you did? It was nothing, right?

Lightning:
Oh, sure, a 100-foot gap is definitely an eyes-closed, piece-of-cake problem.

Dex:
Exactly!

Lightning:
...

Lightning:
If I wanted my words to make it any farther over your head, I'd need a freakin' rocket. 

Lightning:
Okay, cutting all unnecessary wordplay from here on out. 

Lightning:
Let me get straight to the point. Springtrap was right.

Dex:
Ah....right. Then I have nothing to say to you.

Lightning:
Good. Then you'll listen.

Lightning:
What I mean is - she was worried about you. So worried that she was screaming in your face, in fact.

Lightning:
If she really didn't care about you, like you think she does, she would've stood by and watched you throw yourself off that cliff.

Dex:
But it's just her JOB, Lightning. She HAS to do things like that, it being me doesn't make a difference-

Lightning:
Yes it does. Even if she was just doing her duty, she could've stopped at telling you ÅgnoÅh.

Lightning:
But she didn't. She really wanted you to hear her. She wanted you to be okay.

Dex:
....

Dex:
Well, if she really cared...she wouldn't have gone as far as she did.

Lightning:
People make mistakes. I don't think she meant that. Just like you didn't mean everything you said to her.

Dex:
But I-!

Dex:
....

Dex:
*sighs* You're right. It's just that....

Dex:
I am so tired of being constantly bullied around by her. I'm so sick of how she treats me.

Dex:
She goes on and on about how we're all equal when it's so obvious she looks down on me!

Dex:
If you ask me, it's not me who has a ÅghierarchyÅh issue, it's her!

Lightning:
Then you should tell her that.

Dex:
*laughs* Now I KNOW you're joking. She would never even apologize for what she said, let alone listen to me.

Lightning:
You'll never know if you don't try. 

Lightning:
What do you think is gonna happen if you never do anything about it?

Lightning:
I don't think Springtrap will just ASSUME everything you're thinking. 

Lightning:
Unless she's telepathic. In which case, wow, rude for not telling.

Dex:
*laughs* No, she's not telepathic. And...you're right.

Dex:
Nothing will change if I don't tell her that. 

Dex:
But how do you know she won't just get mad at me for saying it?

Lightning:
Dex, Springtrap wasn't mad at you for your thoughts. She was mad because you were insulting her on every other word.

Lightning:
If you just speak calmly...maybe she'll get what you're saying.

Lightning:
You know, without feeling the need for immediate revenge.

Dex:
....

Dex:
Alright. I'll try.

Narrator:
You and Dex return to Springtrap.

End

Lightning:
Whoa, uh, are you-?

Springtrap:
Save your gas. I'm in the mood for talking right now-

Lightning:
CLEARLY. You're more in the mood for yelling, huh?

Springtrap:
YOU-! *sighs* Why are you still here? Don't you have better things to do?

Lightning:
Nah, not really. ÅeSides, it seems like you...need to get some things off your chest. 

Springtrap:
I already told you, I'm not in the mood for talking.

Lightning:
I know. But venting and talking aren't really the same. So...?

Springtrap:
Ugh.

Springtrap:
You're really not gonna leave until I say something, huh?

Lightning:
I seem to recall saying I have nothing better to do.

Springtrap:
....Fine.

Springtrap:
Dex is a dramatic, selfish little BRAT, who needs to get some SEMBLANCE of a grip on reality before he gets himself - or others - KILLED.

Lightning:
...

Springtrap:
...

Lightning:
Wow. How long were you mentally rehearsing that?

Springtrap:
Long enough, apparently.

Lightning:
Feel any better?

Springtrap:
Eh...a little.

Lightning:
You know...if it's any consolation, I think you're right.

Springtrap:
*scoffs* Of COURSE I'm right! That idiot's going to get us all scrapped if he keeps-

Lightning:
AND-

Lightning:
I think you're wrong.

Springtrap:
ÅeScuse me?

Lightning:
Look, Springtrap, you're right. Trying to make a 100-foot leap off of pure willpower is REALLY stupid, and Dex should know better. 

Lightning:
But I can't imagine you really believe everything else you said. 

Springtrap:
You think I care if I hurt his PRECIOUS feelings? 

Lightning:
Uh, yeah. Yeah I do. 

Lightning:
Because the way it sounded, you really do care about Dex.

Lightning:
You see how hard he works to be the best he can be.

Lightning:
And you know much MUCH more than me when it comes to how much being a good leader means to him.

Lightning:
You don't really want him to throw out those parts of himself, do you?

Springtrap:
No I don't-!
Lightning:
So what gives? You just give him a hard time Åecause it makes you feel good? Is that it?

Springtrap:
NO-!

Lightning:
Then is it because-?

Springtrap:
IT'S BECAUSE-

Springtrap:
...

Springtrap:
*sigh*

Springtrap:
It's because, I know he can be better.

Springtrap:
The truth is, I have no doubt in my mind he can make a 100-foot gap jump. 

Lightning:
Wait, seriously?

Springtrap:
Well, metaphorically. The way Dex is...if he can set his mind to it, there's really no telling what he can do.

Springtrap:
But he's completely unfocused! I feel like he's throwing all this potential out the window because his EGO takes up at least 98% of his conscience at any given time.

Springtrap:
If he'd JUST spend the LEAST bit of time on self-reflection, then MAYBE he'd learn something.

Lightning:
Then why don't you tell him that? 

Springtrap:
Oh, please. You saw what just happened. That's what ALWAYS happens. 

Springtrap:
If I told him any of that, he'd just blow up at me again.

Springtrap:
What do you think is gonna happen? He'll suddenly some great epiphany and learn the error of his ways?

Lightning:
Well, One: You never know unless you try, and Two: No I do not think that will happen.

Lightning:
But don't you think the reason you keep failing in the first place has something to do with the way you say it?

Lightning:
If you insult him in every other sentence, do you really think he'll listen?

Springtrap:
Yeah, well HE always-!

Lightning:
HE also shouldn't be. But someone's gotta break the cycle somewhere, right? Otherwise, you're both stuck.

Springtrap:
...

Springtrap:
I know.

Springtrap:
I know that. 

Springtrap:
But I've just been...I don't know.

Springtrap:
I didn't want it to change, I guess.

Springtrap:
*laughs* Guess he wasn't wrong. I really am afraid of things changing.

Springtrap:
But...if it means that maybe something will finally get through his thick SKULL-

Lightning:
Springtrap-

Springtrap:
Sorry - force of habit.

Springtrap:
If it means he'll finally understand what I really mean.

Springtrap:
Then you're right.

Springtrap:
It's worth a shot.

Narrator:
You and Springtrap go to Dex.

End

Dex:
Hey, Springtrap. 

Springtrap:
...Hey.

Dex:
...

Springtrap:
...

Dex:
...I apologize.

Springtrap:
!?

Springtrap:
What? No, Dex, I'm the one who-
Dex:
Listen, I-

Springtrap:
No, YOU listen, I didn't-!

Springtrap:
...

Springtrap:
*chuckles* I'm doing it again, huh?

Dex:
Mhm. It would seem so.

Springtrap:
Ergh, I-...I'm not good at this. 

Springtrap:
You go ahead. I'll listen.

Dex:
Really?

Springtrap:
Yes really. Now hurry it up, I don't have all-!

Springtrap:
...

Springtrap:
Wow, I am REALLY not good at this.

Dex:
*laughs*


Springtrap:
Oh, just get on with it.

Dex:
Right. Well...

Dex:
Springtrap, I...I know you're doing your job. 

Dex:
And being security is...important. We all have our jobs on this crew and you're right.

Dex:
ALL of them are crucial to our survival.

Dex:
But...you treat me like a child every time you see me. 

Dex:
I flinch when you turn my way because I know you'll only insult whatever I'm doing.

Dex:
You're constantly suspicious and probing and I feel like...

Dex:
You don't see any value in me as a crew member...

Dex:
...or even as a person.

Dex:
So it makes me wonder if there's ever going to be a time when you actually see me as an equal, as an individual. 

Dex:
And not just some toddler.

Springtrap:
...

Springtrap:
...Dex-

Dex:
*sighs* And here it comes. Here comes the jab at me.

Dex:
Well, go ahead. I'm used to it by now.

Springtrap:
...Dex, you're really brave.

Dex:
!?

Dex:
Uh, okay, so...NOT what I was expecting-

Dex:
Who are you and what have you done with our vicious guard dog?

Springtrap:
EXCUSE ME!?

Dex:
Ah, there she is.

Springtrap:
GUARD DOG!? YOU-

Springtrap:
...

Springtrap:
Keep it together.

Springtrap:
What I MEANT by that is-

Springtrap:
I DO value you, Dex.

Springtrap:
You're the most ambitious person I could ever imagine.

Springtrap:
You're so optimistic and determined that...I'm envious.

Dex:
So envious that you're -

Springtrap:
Don't say it-

Dex:
 - GREEEEEN with it?

Springtrap:
ALRIGHT THAT'S IT-!

Dex:
*laughs* Wait, wait, wait, I'm sorry, okay?

Dex:
I admire you too.

Springtrap:
Wh-? Really?

Dex:
Yes. 

Dex:
When you...when you mentioned that part back there...about Chief...

Dex:
I couldn't help but think of you.

Dex:
You're responsible. You're careful. You keep an eye on everyone.

Dex:
You always seem to know what you're doing and the truth is -

Dex:
You'd be a good leader. Not me.

Dex:
I'm sorry for those awful things I said about you, I didn't mean to-

Springtrap:
No.

Springtrap:
You don't have to apologize for that. 

Springtrap:
I'm the one who needs to apologize.

Springtrap:
You're right. I've been treating you like a child.

Springtrap:
And it's because...I know how far you can go if you just FOCUS.

Springtrap:
But I never realized how harsh that made me sound. I thought I was Ågwhipping you into shapeÅh I guess, but I was really only driving you further away.

Springtrap:
I'm sorry Dex. I'll try to stop getting on your case so often.

Dex:
...Thank you, Springtrap.

Dex:
I'll try to be more responsible from now on. 50-foot gaps only!

Springtrap:
*sighs* Right. Baby steps.
