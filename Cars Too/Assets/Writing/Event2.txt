Piper:
What's revvin'! 

Lightning:
Back for another check-in?

Piper:
You know it! Wow, looks like you got a good haul of parts too!

$P2

Piper:
Once Springtrap and Dex fix the-

$P0

Piper:
!?

$P1

Narrator:
(Piper is cut off by a commotion nearby.)

Piper:
...Uh oh.

$P5

Lightning:
What's-

Springtrap:
I DON'T CARE! I'm TELLING you that it IS - NOT - SAFE!

$S6

Lightning:
Oh.

Piper:
Springtrap and Dex are at it again.

$P3

Dex:
And I'm telling YOU you have no sense of adventure! We won't get anywhere if we don't try!

$D7

Piper:
Don't worry, they'll probably burn themselves out soon enough. 

$P0

Piper:
I've gotta head back to Chief, I'll catch up with you later. 

Springtrap:
Dex, we've been over this. I'm security, right?

$S7
$D0

Dex:
Yes, but-

Springtrap:
RIGHT?

$S7

Dex:
...right.

$D3

Springtrap:
SO, if you want your WHEELS to stay on your BODY, you'll listen to me when I say -

$S3

Springtrap:
DO NOT TRY THAT JUMP.

$S7

Dex:
You know, Springtrap, you can quit that lying.

Springtrap:
ex-CUSE ME?

$S7

Dex:
*laughs* You don't care about my "safety"!

$D2

Dex:
You just don't like the fact that I'm better than you.

$D0

Springtrap:
WHAT!?

$S6

Dex:
It's obvious you would like nothing better than for me to "know my place" because you're afraid...

Dex:
...I'll take yours.

$D5

Springtrap:
Ooooo - that DOES IT!

$S7

Springtrap:
Lemme make this PERFECTLY - CRYSTAL for you.

$D12

Springtrap:
I couldn't care LESS about some stupid hierarchy you built up yourself in that  bratty little head of yours.

$D32

Springtrap:
NONE of us are better than each other.

Springtrap:
Not Chief, not Mustang, not Piper and ESPECIALLY not YOU.

Dex:
Hey now, don't bring Chief into this, he's our leader, Springtrap!

$D7

Springtrap:
Oh don't you start with that! Chief helps out, but we ALL help out! That doesn't automatically put them above us!

$S6

Dex:
How can you say that after everything they've done for us? We wouldn't be here if it weren't for them-

$D6

Springtrap:
Why do you keep acting like you're indebted to them!? Like something'll go wrong if you don't do what Chief says?

Dex:
Because they KNOW what to do, Springtrap. Why can't YOU have any sense of authority?

$D7

Springtrap:
Because I - for one - take notice when someone's walking all over me.

$S7

Dex:
I do NOT let people walk all-!?

$D6

Springtrap:
How would you even know!? 

$S6

Springtrap:
You're so self-absorbed, I'd bet anything that you can't even see past your own windshield. 

$S7

Dex:
At least I HAVE confidence! You're too scared to drive over GRAVEL, let alone actually get somewhere meaningful.

$D0

Dex:
If YOU were leading this crew, we would've already broken down in a ditch somewhere because you were too afraid to crawl out of it.

$D5

Springtrap:
Are you KIDDING me!? If YOU were leading this crew, we would've EXPLODED somewhere because you can't tell the difference between propane and gasoline!

$S6

Springtrap:
You're SO bent on being this GREAT leader to fill in for Chief, but you just AREN'T.

$S7

Springtrap:
And you'll NEVER be.

Springtrap:

Narrator:

Dex!

Narrator:
(Considering his speed, it takes a little longer than expected to catch up with Dex.)

Narrator:
(In the end, you find him secluded and alone.)

Lightning:
Dex?

Dex:
Ah, Lightning! I'm sorry you had to be there for-

$D5

Dex:
*sniff*

$D4

Lightning:
?? A-Are you-!?

Dex:
NO!

$D6

Dex:
I've just got a bit of oil leakage that's all. It'll fix itself in just a moment.

$D4

Dex:
Did you need something?

Lightning:
No, I...I wanted to see how you were doing. 

Lightning:
And I'm guessing your biggest trouble right now isn't actually just maintenance.

Dex:
No, hah, I suppose it's pretty obvious.

$D3

Lightning:
Listen...I haven't known you all for very long but...

Lightning:
I don't think Springtrap really meant it. What she said to you.

Dex:
*scoffs* Oh really? Because it seemed like a perfect match to me.

$D0

Dex:
She always does this. Always makes me seem like I'm a simple child.

$D3

Lightning:
Well...uh...maybe you are.

Dex:
Pardon!?

$D6

Lightning:
I-I mean, don't take that the wrong way-

Dex:
*laughs* 

$D2

Dex:
How else am I supposed to take it?

$D0

Lightning:
I-...*sigh* Let me explain.

Lightning:
The way it looks to me - at least after that big blow-up - is that Springtrap really cares about you.

Dex:
Sorry, are your headlights broken? Were you even there for what just happened?

$D2

Lightning:
Yeah, I was. And I also saw that jump you were attempting.

Dex:
Oh you did? It was nothing, right?

$D5

Lightning:
Oh, sure, a 100-foot gap is definitely an eyes-closed, piece-of-cake problem.

Dex:
Exactly! I don't see what all the fuss is about!

$D2

Lightning:
...

$D5

Lightning:
If I wanted my words to make it any farther over your head, I'd need a freakin' rocket. 

Lightning:
*inhales* Okay, I am cutting all unnecessary wordplay from here on out. 

$D1

Lightning:
Let me get straight to the point. Springtrap was right.

Dex:
Ah...I see. Then I have nothing to say to you.

$D0

Lightning:
Good. Then you'll listen.

$D1

Lightning:
What I mean is - she was worried about you. So worried that she was screaming in your face, in fact.

Lightning:
If she REALLY didn't care about you, like you think she does, she would've stepped aside and gladly watched you throw yourself off that cliff.

$D3

Dex:
But it's just her JOB, Lightning. She HAS to do things like that. 

Dex:
The fact that it was me doesn't make a difference-

Lightning:
Yes it does. Even if she was just doing her duty, she could've stopped after telling you "no".

Lightning:
But she didn't. She really wanted you to hear her. She wanted you to be okay.

Dex:
...

Dex:
Well, if she REALLY cared, as you say...

Dex:
She wouldn't have gone as far as she did.

$D4

Lightning:
People make mistakes. She didn't mean everything she said. Just like YOU didn't mean everything YOU said.

Dex:
...

Dex:
*sighs* You're right. It's just that...

$D3

Dex:
I am EXHAUSTED.

$D4

Dex:
I am tired of her constant bullying. I'm so sick of how she treats me.

Dex:
She goes on and on about how we're all equal when it's so obvious she looks down on me!

$D7

Dex:
If you ask me, it's not me who has a "hierarchy" issue, it's her!

Lightning:
Then you should tell her that.

Narrator:
(Dex laughs wryly and shakes his head.)

$D2

Dex:
Now I KNOW you're joking. She would never even apologize for what she said, let alone listen to me.

$D5

Lightning:
You'll never know if you don't try. 

$D0

Lightning:
What do you think is gonna happen if you never do anything about it?

$D3

Lightning:
I don't think Springtrap will just ASSUME everything you're thinking. 

Lightning:
Unless she's telepathic. In which case, wow, rude for not telling.

Dex:
*laughs* No, she's not telepathic. And...you're right.

$D2

Dex:
Nothing will change if I don't tell her that. 

$D3

Dex:
But how do you know she won't just get mad at me for saying it?

$D4

Lightning:
Dex, Springtrap wasn't mad at you for your thoughts. She was mad because you were insulting her on every other word.

$D3

Lightning:
If you just speak calmly...maybe she'll get what you're saying.

Lightning:
You know - WITHOUT feeling the need for immediate revenge.

Dex:
...

Dex:
Oh, alright. I'll try.

$D5

Narrator:
(You and Dex return to Springtrap.)

End

Lightning:
Whoa...er...that was a little-

Springtrap:
Save your gas. I'm not in the gear for talking right now-

$S0

Lightning:
CLEARLY. You're more in the mood for yelling, huh?

Springtrap:
YOU-! 

$S6

Springtrap:
*sighs* Why are you still here? Don't you have better things to do?

$S5

Lightning:
Nah, not really. ÅeSides, it seems like you...need to get some things off your chest. 

Springtrap:
I already told you, I'm not in the mood for talking.

$S7

Lightning:
I know. But venting and talking aren't really the same. 

Lightning:
So...?

Springtrap:
Ugh.

$S5

Springtrap:
You're really not gonna leave until I say something, huh?

Lightning:
I DO recall saying I have nothing better to do.

Springtrap:
...Fine.

$S0

Springtrap:
*inhales*

Springtrap:
Dex is a dramatic, attention-seeking, self-important dust devil who DESPERATELY needs some SEMBLANCE of a grip on reality before he gets himself - or others - KILLED.

$S7

Springtrap:
His absolute IGNORANCE puts all of us at risk, and me being his damn NANNY is the only thing that stands between him and his expiration date. 

Lightning:
...

Springtrap:
...

Lightning:
Wow. How long were you mentally rehearsing that?

Springtrap:
Long enough, apparently.

$S3

Lightning:
Feel any better?

Springtrap:
Eh...a little.

$S5

Lightning:
You know - if it's any consolation - I think you're right.

Springtrap:
*scoffs* Of COURSE I'm right! That idiot's going to get us all scrapped if he keeps-

$S0

Lightning:
AND-

Lightning:
I think you're wrong.

Springtrap:
Uh!? Wanna say that again?

$S7

Lightning:
Look, Springtrap, you're right. Trying to make a 100-foot leap off of pure willpower is REALLY stupid, and Dex should know better. 

Lightning:
But I can't imagine you really meant everything else you said. 

Springtrap:
AW, you think I care if I hurt his PRECIOUS feelings?

$S2 

Lightning:
Uh, yeah. Yeah I do. 

$S3

Lightning:
Because the way it sounded, you really do care about Dex.

$S5

Lightning:
You see how hard he works to be where he is.

Lightning:
And you know way - WAY - more than me when it comes to how much being a good leader means to him.

Lightning:
You don't really want him to throw out those parts of himself, do you?

Springtrap:
No, I don't-!

$S3

Lightning:
So what gives? You just give him a hard time Åecause it makes you feel good? Is that it?

Springtrap:
NO-!

$S1

Lightning:
Then is it because-?

Springtrap:
IT'S BECAUSE-

$S6

Springtrap:
...

Springtrap:
*sigh*

$S5

Springtrap:
It's because, I know he can be better.

Springtrap:
The truth is, I have no doubt in my mind he can make a 100-foot gap jump. 

$S0

Lightning:
Wait, seriously?

Springtrap:
Well, metaphorically. 

Springtrap:
The way Dex is...if he can set his mind to it, there's no telling what he can do.

$S3

Springtrap:
But he's completely unfocused! I feel like he's throwing all this potential out the window because his EGO takes up at least 98% of his mental real estate at any given time.

$S7

Springtrap:
If he'd JUST spend the LEAST bit of time on self-reflection, then MAYBE he'd learn something.

$S0

Lightning:
Then why don't you tell him that? 

Springtrap:
Oh, please. You saw what just happened. That's what ALWAYS happens. 

$S5

Springtrap:
If I told him any of that, he'd just blow up at me again.

Springtrap:
You think that'll change? That he'll suddenly have some great epiphany and learn the error of his ways?

$S0

Lightning:
Well, 1: You never know unless you try, and 2: No I do not think that will happen.

Lightning:
But don't you think the reason you keep failing in the first place has something to do with the WAY you speak to him?

$S3

Lightning:
If you insult him in every other sentence, do you really think he'll listen?

Springtrap:
Yeah, well HE'S the one who always-!

$S6

Lightning:
HE also shouldn't be insulting you. 

Lightning:
But someone's gotta break the cycle somewhere, right? Otherwise, you're both stuck.

$S0

Springtrap:
...

Springtrap:
I know.

$S5

Springtrap:
I know that. 

Springtrap:
But I've just been...I don't know.

Springtrap:
I didn't want to try changing anything.

Springtrap:
If I did...I might mess up big time. I might just make things worse.

$S3

Springtrap:
*scoffs* Guess he wasn't wrong about me. I really am afraid of...change.

$S5

Springtrap:
But if it means that maybe something will finally get through his thick SKULL-

$S7

Lightning:
Springtrap-

Springtrap:
Sorry - force of habit.

$S3

Springtrap:
If it means he'll finally understand what I really mean-

$S5

Springtrap:
Then you're right.

$S0

Springtrap:
It's worth a shot.

Narrator:
(You and Springtrap go to Dex)

End

Dex:
Hello, Springtrap. 

$D5

Springtrap:
...Yo.

$S0

Dex:
...

$D0

Springtrap:
...

Dex:
...I apologize.

$D3

Springtrap:
!?

$S6

Springtrap:
What? No, Dex, I'm the one who-

Dex:
Listen, I-

Springtrap:
No, YOU listen, I didn't mean-!

$S7
$D6

Springtrap:
...

$S3
$D3

Springtrap:
*chuckles* I'm doing it again, huh?

$S5

Dex:
Mhm. It would seem so.

$D5

Springtrap:
Ergh, I'm not good at this. 

Dex:
That's okay. I'm not...I'm not either.

$D3

Springtrap:
!!

$S3

Narrator:
(Springtrap is shocked by his genuine modesty. Her demeanor softens, just slightly.)

Springtrap:
You go ahead. I'll listen.

$S0

Dex:
Really?

$D6

Springtrap:
Yes really. Now hurry it up, I don't have all-!

$S6

Springtrap:
...

$D52

Springtrap:
Wow, I am REALLY not good at this.

$S5

Dex:
*laughs*

$D2

Springtrap:
Oh, just get on with it.

$S7

Dex:
Right. Well...

$D0

Dex:
Springtrap, I...I know you're doing your job. 

$D3

Dex:
And being security is...important. We all have our jobs on this crew and you're right.

$S02

Dex:
ALL of them are crucial to our survival.

Dex:
But...you treat me like a child every time you see me. 

$D7

Dex:
I tend to flinch when you turn my way because I know you're about to insult whatever I'm doing.

$D3

Dex:
You're constantly suspicious and probing and it makes me feel like...

Dex:
You don't see any value in me as a crew member.

Dex:
Or even as a person.

$D4

Dex:
So it makes me wonder if there's ever going to be a time when you actually see me as an equal, as an individual. 

$S32

Dex:
And not just some toddler.

Springtrap:
...

$S5

Springtrap:
...Dex-

Dex:
*sighs* And here it comes.

$D0

Dex:
Well, go ahead. I'm used to it by now.

$S32

Springtrap:
...Dex, you're really brave.

$S0

Dex:
!?

$D6

Dex:
Alright, so...NOT what I was expecting-

$D1

Dex:
Um, who are you and what have you done with the Spirit's vicious guard dog?

$S62

Springtrap:
WHAT WAS THAT!?

Dex:
Ah, there she is.

$D2

Springtrap:
GUARD DOG!? YOU-

$D02

Springtrap:
...

Springtrap:
*muttering* Keep it together.

$S7

Springtrap:
What I MEANT by that is-

Springtrap:
I DO value you, Dex.

$S3

Springtrap:
You're the most ambitious person I could ever imagine.

$D32

Springtrap:
You're so optimistic and determined that...I'm envious.

$S5

Dex:
So envious that you're -

$D0

Springtrap:
Don't say it-

$S7

Dex:
 - GREEEEEN with it?

$D5

Springtrap:
ALRIGHT THAT'S IT-!

$S6

Dex:
*laughs* Wait, wait, wait, I'm sorry, okay?

$D2

Dex:
I admire you too.

$D5

Springtrap:
Wh-? Really?

$S1

Dex:
Yes. 

$D0

Dex:
When you...when you mentioned that thing back there...about Chief...

$D3

Dex:
I couldn't help but think of you.

$D5
$S3

Dex:
You're responsible. You're careful. You keep an eye on everyone.

$S52

Dex:
You always seem to know what you're doing and the truth is -

$D3

Dex:
You'd be a good leader. Not me.

$D4

Dex:
I'm sorry for those awful things I said about you, I didn't mean to-

Springtrap:
No.

$S0

Springtrap:
You don't have to apologize for that. 

$D32

Springtrap:
I'm the one who needs to apologize.

$S5

Springtrap:
You're right. I've been treating you like a child.

Springtrap:
And it's because...I know how far you can go if you just FOCUS.

$S0

Springtrap:
But I never realized how harsh that made me sound. I thought I was "whipping you into shape".

$S5 

Springtrap:
But I can see I was only driving you further away.

$S4

Dex:
Aw, Springtrap are you-!?

$D6

Springtrap: 
I-IT'S JUST OIL LEAKAGE, THAT'S ALL!

$S6

Dex:
*laughs*

$D2

Springtrap:
Listen -

$S3

Springtrap:
I'm sorry Dex. I'll try to stop getting on your case so often.

$S5

Dex:
...Thank you, Springtrap.

$D5

Dex:
And I'll try to be more responsible from now on. 50-foot gaps only!

$D2

Springtrap:
*sighs* Right. Baby steps. 

$S0
