Lightning:
Alright, Gak, I'm fixing the door now.

Gak:
Oh good! Can't wait to get out of this cursed room.

Lightning:
How did you get stuck up there in the first place?

Gak:
Well aren't you nosey.

Lightning:
Hey, I'm getting you out of this mess, the least you could do is tell me how you got in it.

Gak:
Oh NOW we're making deals?

Lightning:
That does seem to be your language. So?

Gak:
Fine, but I'll keep it brief. 

Lightning:
Like you've got other things to do?

Gak:
Now-! Do you want the damn story or not!?

Lightning:
*laughs*

Lightning:
YES, yes, sheesh. Continue, please.

Gak:
No interruptions.

Gak:
I woke up about 3 months ago, way back east.

Gak:
Nobody else had woken up yet back there, 'least from what I could tell.

Gak:
I didn't really see any reason to stick around the junkyard, so I just started driving. When I hit water, I started driving the other way.

Gak:
And along the way I saw...

Gak:
...

Lightning:
You saw...?

Gak:
It doesn't matter. What matters is I decided to get out of there. Get off-planet.

Gak:
Get somewhere new. 

Gak:
So I found out about this factory and started searching for it. And now I'm here.

Lightning:
...Oh.

Gak:
Oh?

Lightning:
Nothing I just...nevermind.

Gak:
Now who's being the quiet one?

Lightning:
Alright already. 

Lightning:
The door should be fixed now.  Try the panel.

Narrator:
(The door opens)

Gak:
Hah! It worked! 

Lightning:
Told you I was good with tools.

Lightning:
You can get out now.

Gak:
Actually...I kinda can't.

Lightning:
Oh boy.

Narrator:
(Gak sits at the back of the control room, their tires stuck under a collapsed computer cabinet)

Gak:
I'm STUCK stuck.

Lightning:
I thought you said only the door closed behind you?

Gak:
That WAS all that happened. But then I tried looking for something I could use to get the door open and...well...

Gak:
Can you blame me for lying? My pride's on the line here.

Lightning:
And I'm sure you're very proud. Now come on-

Narrator:
(You position yourself beside Gak)

Lightning:
1...

Lightning:
2...

Lightning:
PUSH!

Narrator:
(You push and Gak rolls out from under the cabinet and out of the ditch they were caught in)

Gak:
Phew. Glad that's over with, finally. 

Lightning:
So what were you planning here, then?

Gak:
Uh...a rocket? Duh.

Gak:
If you look out the window, you can see it from here.

Lightning:
Whoa...is it done!?

Gak:
No, no, no, of course not. 

Gak:
If it was done I wouldn't still be in the desert, I'd be UP THERE.

Gak:
Where none of this scrap matters.

Lightning:
Right...

Gak:
What were you doing around this factory anyway?

Gak:
'Cause if you're here to steal, you've got another thing coming.

Lightning:
Whoa whoa whoa, no one's stealing anything. 

Lightning:
If I was gonna steal, don't you think I would have done it while you were stuck in a ditch?

Gak:
Then what ARE you here for?

Lightning:
I thought you DIDN'T want my life story?

Gak:
The abridged version that doesn't incriminate you would be nice.

Lightning:
Again - not a criminal. 

Gak:
I'll be the one making that call.

Lightning:
*sigh* Okay. Look. I'm actually here for the same reason you are.

Lightning:
I heard about this place a while back too, and now I'm here to use it.

Gak:
You...You are? You wanna get off this wasteland too?

Lightning:
No! I mean, yeah, er...obviously...

Gak:
THANK the stars there's actually someone else who ISN'T a complete IDIOT!

Gak:
This rock has done NOTHING for us.

Gak:
Those humans destroyed it for some stupid reason, and they think they can leave the cleanup to us!?

Gak:
I mean, the AUDACITY! 

Gak:
Just because they made us doesn't mean we should be sweeping up THEIR messes.

Lightning:
Yeah...Yeah, exactly.

Gak:
Who do they think they are trying to order us around from beyond the grave!?

Gak:
They're DEAD! This planet is EMPTY. 

Gak:
There's no point in staying. 

Gak:
And those other morons are only more reason to leave.

Lightning:
Wait, other morons?

Gak:
YES! All those stupid cars thinking they'll be anything better than SCRAP.

Lightning:
Well...I mean, I've met some other cars. I don't know if I'd call them morons, though.

Gak:
Oh, *really*?

Lightning:
They had a crew, a goal. I wouldn't call that just scrap, right?

Gak:
*laughs* They're just kidding themselves.

Gak:
Now, *us* on the other hand-

Gak:
WE'RE the ones who are going to find a REAL purpose, and it's gonna be way beyond this abandoned rock.

Gak:
Right?

Lightning:
Uh-

Gak:
Hang on-

Narrator:
(Gak moves a little closer to you. Your trunk had popped open sometime during the rescue, and Gak can see something reflecting from within.)

Gak:
What are those?

Lightning:
What? Oh, these?

Narrator:
(You remember the parts the Spirit Crew gave you. Packed in the trunk.)

Lightning:
They're parts that...that Chief...

Gak:
Well hand 'em over!

Lightning:
!? What?

Gak:
Let's have a look! We might be able to finish that rocket up! Then it's home-free!

Lightning:
Oh, sure, I-I guess.

Narrator:
(You let the parts slide out of your trunk and Gak examines them on the floor)

Gak:
Hmmm...yeah! Yeah this all looks like it'll work! Let's head down-

Lightning:
Actually-

Gak:
? 

Gak:
What?

EndC

Choices
I can't let you use these parts
These parts are from my friends

Lightning:
I can't let you use these parts.

Gak:
...

Gak:
What did you say?

Lightning:
Not yet, anyway. 

Lightning:
There are things I still need to figure out with them-

End

Lightning:
These parts...they were from my friends.

Gak:
...

Gak:
What did you say.

Lightning:
My friends. Who are also cars.

Lightning:
They gave them to me.

Lightning:
I can't just let them get used like that-

End

Gak:
I don't think so.

Narrator:
(Suddenly, a grapple shoots out from beneath Gak's fender, and latches onto the box)

Narrator:
(Gak pulls the box around to their own trunk and toss it in)

Lightning:
HEY! What are you doing!?

Gak:
Something you obviously don't have the horsepower to do.

Gak:
I have to get off this rock, and I'm not gonna let your indecision keep me from it.

Lightning:
No, hey, just wait a sec, okay?

Lightning:
I DID come here to leave, alright? I did.

Lightning:
But don't you realize what leaving means?

Lightning:
You'll never know if there are people down here for you! 

Lightning:
What if you're leaving them too?

Gak:
*laughs*

Gak:
I already did.

Lightning:
What do you m-?

Narrator:
(Before you can advance on them, Gak revs up and rams you, bending your fender and knocking you back.)

Narrator:
(You feel your back wheels slip into the same ditch Gak was trapped in.)

Narrator:
(You fire up your engine, but your wheels spin uselessly against the rubbled floor.)

Lightning:
No, Gak! 

Narrator:
(Gak backs away from you.)

Gak:
You know, Lightning...

Gak:
This room's pretty unstable.

Gak:
That's actually how I got stuck in the first place. Messing with a switchboard for old, volatile machines didn't exactly heed the best results.

Narrator:
(You watch as Gak moves to the control panel.)

Lightning:
No, don't-

Gak:
It can be very dangerous. You should really get out of here.

Narrator:
(Gak makes their way toward the door you opened for them.)

Lightning:
Gak, stop!

Lightning:
I cannot stress how much you don't have to do this.

Gak:
Oh, I know.

Narrator:
(Gak rolls outside to safety.)

Gak:
I just don't care.
