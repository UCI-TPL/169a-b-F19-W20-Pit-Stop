Lightning:
Alright, I found all the parts, fixing the door now.


Gak:
Oh good! Can't wait to get out of this cursed room.


Lightning:
How did you get stuck up here in the first place?


Gak:
Well aren't you nosey.


Lightning:
Hey, I'm getting you out of this mess, the least you could do is tell me how you got in it.


Gak:
Oh now we're making deals?


Lightning:
That does seem to be your language. So?


Gak:
Ugh, fine, but I'll keep it brief. 


Lightning:
Like you've got other things to do?


Gak:
Oh, you-you-! Do you want the damn story or not?


Lightning:
*laughs*


Lightning:
YES, yes, sheesh. Continue, please.


Gak:
No interruptions.


Gak:
I woke up about 3 months ago, way back east.


Gak:
Nobody else had woken up yet back there, 'least from what I could tell.


Gak:
I didn't really see any reason to stick around the junkyard, so I just started driving. When I hit water, I started driving the other way.


Gak:
And along the way I saw....


Gak:
....

Lightning:
You saw...?

Gak:
It doesn't matter. What matters is I decided to get out of here. 


Gak:
So I started searching for this space station. And now I'm here.


Lightning:
....Oh.


Gak:
Oh?


Lightning:
Nothing I just...nevermind.


Gak:
Now who's being the quiet one?


Lightning:
Alright already. 


Lightning:
The door should be fixed now.  Try the panel.

Gak:
Hah! It worked! 


Lightning:
Told you I was good with tools.


Lightning:
You can get out now.


Gak:
Actually....I kinda can't.


Lightning:
Oh boy.

Gak:
I'm STUCK stuck.


Lightning:
I thought you said only the door closed behind you?


Gak:
That WAS all that happened. But then I tried looking for something I could use to get the door open and....well....


Gak:
Can you blame me for lying? My pride's on the line here.


Lightning:
And I'm sure you're very proud. Now come on-

Lightning:
1...


Lightning:
2...


Lightning:
PUSH!

Gak:
Phew. Glad that's over with, finally. 


Lightning:
So what were you planning here, then?


Gak:
Uh....A rocket? Duh.


Gak:
If you look out the window there, you can see it from here.

Lightning:
Whoa....is it done!?


Gak:
No, no, no, of course not. 


Gak:
If it was done I wouldn't be in the desert. I'd be up there.


Gak:
Where none of this garbage matters.


Lightning:
Right....


Gak:
What were you doing around this space station anyway?


Gak:
'Cause if you're here to steal, you've got another thing coming.


Lightning:
Whoa whoa whoa, no one's stealing anything. 


Lightning:
If I was gonna steal, don't you think I would have done it while you were stuck in a ditch?


Gak:
Then what ARE you here for?


Lightning:
Hmmm, I thought you didn't want my life story?


Gak:
The abridged version that doesn't criminalize you would be nice.


Lightning:
Again - not a criminal. 


Gak:
I'll be the one making that call.


Lightning:
*sigh* Okay. Look. I'm actually here for the same reason you are.


Lightning:
I heard about this space station a while back too, and now I'm here to use it.


Gak:
You....You are? You wanna get off this wasteland too?


Lightning:
No! I mean, yeah, er...obviously....


Gak:
THANK the stars there's actually someone else who ISN'T a complete IDIOT!


Gak:
This rock has done NOTHING for us.


Gak:
Those humans destroyed it for some stupid reason, and they think they can leave the cleanup to us!?


Gak:
I mean, the AUDACITY! 


Gak:
Just because they made us doesn't mean we should be sweeping up THEIR messes.


Lightning:
Yeah....yeah, exactly.


Gak:
Who do they think they are trying to order us around from beyond the grave!?


Gak:
They're DEAD! This planet is EMPTY. 


Gak:
There's no point in staying. 


Gak:
And those other morons are only more reason to leave.


Lightning:
Wait, uh....other morons?


Gak:
YES! All those stupid cars thinking they'll be anything better than SCRAP.


Lightning:
Well....I mean, I've met some other cars. I don't know if I'd call them morons, though.


Gak:
Oh, *really*?


Lightning:
They had a crew, a goal. I wouldn't call that just scrap, right?


Gak:
*laughs* They're just kidding themselves.


Gak:
Now, US on the other hand-


Gak:
We're the ones who are going to find a REAL purpose, and it's gonna be way beyond this abandoned rock.


Gak:
Right?


Lightning:
Uh-


Gak:
Hang on.

Gak:
What are those?


Lightning:
What? Oh, these?


Lightning:
They're parts that....that Chief....-


Gak:
Well hand 'em over!


Lightning:
!? What?


Gak:
Let's have a look! We might be able to finish that rocket up! Then it's home free!


Lightning:
Oh, sure, I guess.

Gak:
Hmmm....yeah! Yeah this all looks like it'll work! Let's head down-


Lightning:
Actually...


Gak:
? 


Gak:
What?


EndC


Choices
I can't let you use these parts
These parts are from my friends


Lightning:
I can't let you use these parts.


Gak:
.....


Gak:
What did you say?


Lightning:
Not yet, anyway. 


Lightning:
There are things I still need to figure out with them-

End


Lightning:
These parts....they were from my friends.


Gak:
.....


Gak:
What did you say.


Lightning:
My friends. Who are also cars.


Lightning:
They gave them to me.


Lightning:
I can't just let them get used like that-

End

Gak:
I don't think so.

Lightning:
HEY! What are you doing!?


Gak:
Something you obviously don't have the guts to do.


Gak:
I have to get off this rock, and I'm not gonna let your indecision keep me from it.


Lightning:
No, hey, just wait a sec, okay?


Lightning:
I DID come here to leave, alright? I did.

Lightning:
But don't you realize what leaving means?


Lightning:
You'll never know if there are people down here for you! 


Lightning:
What if you're leaving them too?


Gak:
*laughs*


Gak:
I already did.

Lightning:
No, Gak! 


Gak:
You know, this room's pretty unstable, Lightning.


Gak:
That's actually how I got stuck in the first place. Messing with volatile control panels didn't heed the best results.

Lightning:
No, don't-


Gak:
It can be very dangerous. You should really get out of here.

Lightning:
Stop!

Lightning:
Gak, I cannot stress how much you don't have to do this.

Gak:
Oh, I know.

Gak:
I just don't care.
