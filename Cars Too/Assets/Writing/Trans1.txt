Chief:
Found what you could?


Lightning:
Yes sir.


Chief:
Good. Those parts will be essential for Mustang's purifier. Once we get those toxins in the air out of our way, we can start fixing things around here.


Springtrap:
Yo, chief.


Springtrap:
I got that bridge fixed. We have full access to that new area for parts now.


Chief:
Then we're moving. I'll tell the others and let them know they can enter….hmmm….


Springtrap:
What is it?


Chief:
Do we have a name for the place yet?


Piper:
OO OO! Did I just hear “naming”!???


Springtrap:
Here we go.


Chief:
Affirmative. Springtrap just fixed the bridge to a new, unnamed area.


Springtrap:
Do we really have to name it? It's just another abandoned place chock full of radiation.


Piper:
Hey, that's it! Radiation, and Springtrap cleared the way to it-


Piper:
So how about Springs of Radiation!


Springtrap:
*rubs the back of her head* Uhm, I mean, all I did was fix the bridge-


Chief:
It's a wonderful name, Piper.


Chief:
Okay everyone. If you still got stuff to do here feel free to stay. Otherwise, let's move out!
