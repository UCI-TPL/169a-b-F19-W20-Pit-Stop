Lightning:
It wouldn't hurt to try one more time.

Narrator:
(You turn on your radio with a *click*)

Lightning:
Piper, can you hear me?

Narrator:
(Nothing but static.)

Lightning:
Springtrap?

Lightning:
Dex? Mustang?

Narrator:
(Nothing but static.)

Lightning:
...

Lightning:
Chief?

Narrator:
(Nothing but static.)

Narrator:
(You hear your radio switch on.)

Lightning:
!!

???:
Hello? Someone there?

Lightning:
Yes! I'm here-!

???:
Oh thank the stars! Someone's actually here!

Lightning:
Wait.

Lightning:
You're not...

Lightning:
Who is this?

Gak:
Right, sorry! I was just so excited to hear someone! My name is Gak.

Gak:
You have no idea how long I've been flipping through frequencies, praying to some big car god that someone would hear me!

Gak:
Guess I've gotta build a shrine now, or something.

Lightning:
I'm Lightning.

Lightning:
Why were you going through frequencies? Where are you?

Gak:
Well that's just the thing, I need help. Bad.

Gak:
I'm trapped in this factory. One of these decrepit machines broke down and the door out of the room I'm in got stuck. 

Gak:
Those stupid humans had to make these things out of titanium, there's no way I can open it.

Lightning:
You want me to get you out?

Gak:
Yeah that's the idea, genius.

Lightning:
Dude.

Gak:
Er, sorry.

Gak:
Being stuck in a room for so long drives your impatience through the roof. 

Lightning:
Ah, car puns.

Gak:
...What?

Lightning:
You know, "through the roof"?

Gak:
??

Lightning:
'Cause cars have a...have a roof-?

Gak:
Look, I just wanna get out of here. Maybe help me before you start making jokes.

Lightning:
Uh, yeah, sorry. What do you need?

Gak:
I NEED a way out. Are you in the factory?

Lightning:
Yes, I'm on the first floor.

Gak:
Good. I'm in the third level control room. 

Gak:
There's an elevator door there on the first level that leads directly to me. 

Gak:
It might be jammed right now, but you should be able to get it working again.

Gak:
Please tell me you can do that?

Lightning:
Yeah, I bet I can figure out. I'm pretty good with tools. Actually I-

Gak:
I don't need your life story. Just get me out of here.

Gak:
I can make it worth your time too. This place has got all kinds of shinies. Maybe we could make some kind of trade?

Lightning:
Oh, I'm not really looking to trade-

Gak:
Then don't waste time.

Lightning:
Okay, see you-

Narrator:
(The mysterious "Gak" suddenly hangs up.)

Lightning:
...then.

Lightning:
Well, they're a charmer.
