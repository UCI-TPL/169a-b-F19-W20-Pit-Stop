Dex:
Hey there! What's cookin' good lookin'?

Lightning:
...

Lightning:
Excuse me?

Dex:
Oh, my bad!

Dex:
I should've let you put your sunroof on before DAZZLING you with my presence!

Lightning:
Oh. I see.

Lightning:
Are you Dex?

Dex:
THE one and only! Five time world-class champion of the Nova Circuit, the Krystal Circuit, the Rodney Circuit, AND -

Dex:
The Ultimate Rocket Raceway.

Lightning:
Isn't that a go-kart track?

Dex:
If it's got a checkered flag at the end of it, I've won it.

Lightning:
How noble.

Dex:
Of course, I assume you've heard of me?

Lightning:
Piper mentioned you once or twice.

Lightning:
She described you as "overwhelming at times"

Dex:
Hah! 

Dex:
Well, it's not MY fault it's hard to keep my pure awesomeness from the exhaust!

Dex:
You know, I could teach you a thing or two. It's important to give back to the little guys, right?

Lightning:
Little guys?

Dex:
Piper told me about you too. She said you're here to help look for parts, yeah?

Dex:
If you get stuck, don't hesitate to come get me! Helping out the inexperienced is MY specialty.

Lightning:
Wow. Thanks.

Lightning:
I'll keep that in mind.
