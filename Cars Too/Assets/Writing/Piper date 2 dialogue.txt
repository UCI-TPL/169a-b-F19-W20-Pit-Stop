Lightning:
Hey, you wanna hang out again?

Piper:
Abso-toot-ly!

$P2

Lightning:
...On second thought.....

Piper:
Oh, quit it! I know your game.

$P4

Lightning:
What game?

Piper:
Doing this whole "tough motor" routine.

$P0

Lightning:
It's not a "routine"!

Piper:
Mhm. Being defensive DEFINITELY helps your case.

$P5

Lightning:
I'm NOT-!

Lightning:
*sigh*

Lightning:
How do you know how to push all my buttons?

Piper:
It's what I'm built for, silly!

$P2

Piper:
So what'd you wanna talk about?

$P0

Lightning:
Well, you're always digging things up, so I'm curious -

EndC

Choices
What's the worst thing you've found?
What's the best thing you've found?

Piper:
Ooooooooo, uh, well -

$P1

Piper:
That's a toughie. 

$P5

Piper:
Human society broke down so long ago and...

$P3

Piper:
To be honest, sometimes it's hard to look at all this "junk" as you'd like to call it.

Piper:
So I guess, on one hand, everything I've come across is the worst thing I've found. 

Piper:
Toys, art, inventions, skyscrapers, homes -

$P5

Piper:
It all points to this exciting and bustling place!

$P0

Piper:
And that's what I love about it! I really do!

$P2

Piper:
But at the same time-

$P5

Piper:
It makes seeing it all empty so much worse.

$P3

Piper:
There USED to be people here.

Piper:
People used to walk these roads. Play in these fields. Invent in those buildings.

Piper:
Seeing everything abandoned is sad sometimes.

Piper:
But I can't let it get to me!

$P4

End

Piper:
Oooooo, uh, well-

$P1

Piper:
That's a toughie.

$P5

Piper:
After all, I love everything I come across!

$P2

Narrator:
(Piper holds up a metal bowl with lots of tiny holes in it)

Piper:
I mean look at this thing! What the heck was this used for?

$P6

Piper:
My theory is that it's a helmet of some sorts, to protect workers from certain substances.

$P5

Piper:
Or-Or from maybe falling debris when they were building these massive things!

$P0

Piper:
Right now, this is the best thing I've found!

$P2

Piper:
But tomorrow, it'll probably be something else, and something else after that!

$P0

Piper:
Even though it's all so old, it'll always be new to me.

$P5

End

Piper:
Human society left so much behind, it would be irresponsible of me to not look at it all!

$P0

Piper:
What about you?

Lightning:
Me?

Piper:
Yeah, what do you think of human society?

Lightning:
You already know what I think.

Piper:
Nope!

$P2

Piper:
I know what you THOUGHT!

$P5

Piper:
But now you've seen more than you ever got to see in that desert.

$P0

Piper:
So what's the verdict now?

Lightning:
Uh, well...

EndC

Choices
I still think it's not worth looking into.
I think it's interesting.

Lightning:
I still think it's not worth looking into.

Lightning:
They all died a long time ago.

Lightning:
And I don't wanna go sticking my hood into why that happened.

Piper:
*GASP!!!*

$P6

Lightning:
?

Lightning:
What?

Piper:
You just unironically used a car pun!!!

Lightning:
What? No I didn't!

Piper:
*laughs*

$P2

Piper:
Yeah you did~!

Lightning:
Alright, fine, I did, whatever!

Piper:
This is so going into my journal-

$P0

Lightning:
ANYWAY -

Lightning:
My point is, why in the world would you want to go looking into how they all died?

Lightning:
What if that ends up happening to us too?

Lightning:
All because we were meddling with something we shouldn't have.

Piper:
Oh, Lightning.

$P5

Piper:
That's not what history's about! 

Piper:
Yes, the humans all died but it was probably because of some stupid mistake!

$P0

Piper:
And mistakes happen. They happen to all of us!

Piper:
All we can do is try our best to prevent them.

$P5

Piper:
And we can't do that without acknowledging them first.

End

Lightning:
Actually, I...

Lightning:
Yeah. I think it's interesting.

Piper:
Oh, Lightning, you can't always think that way! Remember you have to-

$P3

Piper:
...

$P1

Piper:
Wait.

Piper:
Did you say you...

Piper:
You DO think it's interesting???

$P6

Lightning:
Well, yeah. 

Piper:
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!

$P2

Lightning:
...

Lightning:
Hello. Testing.

Lightning:
Cool, I didn't just go deaf.

Piper:
THIS IS SO MOTORIFIC!

Piper:
You actually like this kinda stuff now?? You don't think it's junk?

$P0

Lightning:
Yeah, I guess?

Lightning:
I mean, you're right. 

Lightning:
I've seen more with the Spirit Crew than I ever would have seen in that desert.

Lightning:
And humans are....

Lightning:
Now, disclaimer, I still think you give humans way more credit than they deserve-

Lightning:
But after seeing all the stuff you've dug up....

Lightning:
I see now that they really did care about things. Other than killing the planet, anyways.

Lightning:
Ignoring it would just make us...

Piper:
Ignorant?

$P5

Lightning:
I was trying to find a word a little less on the nose, but yeah.

Piper:
I think you're right!

$P2

Piper:
We can't ignore their world history, because their world history is our world history!

$P0

End

Piper:
There's an old human quote that goes-

$P0

Piper:
"Those who do not learn from history are doomed to eat it."

Lightning:
...

Lightning:
What the heck does that mean?

Piper:
I dunno, the words were pretty smeared -

$P1

Piper:
But-! I think it means we have to learn from the past to save our future!

$P2

Piper:
So that's what I'm doing here. 

$P0

Piper:
Do you think that's dumb of me?

$P3

EndC

Choices
Yep. Totally.
Not at all.

Piper:
Seriously?

$P6

Lightning:
Yeah. But you know what-

Lightning:
You're doing what you love. And you have a fun time with it.

End

Piper:
Really?

$P2

Lightning:
Yeah. It's important for you guys to know what happened.

Lightning:
Like you said, you have to learn from the past.

End

Lightning:
In the end, I think that's all that matters.

Piper:
Yeah... 

$P5

Piper:
Thanks, Lightning. That makes me feel better!

$P2

Piper:
Well, I think we'd better hit the road again.

$P0

Piper:
It was a pleasure, as always!
