Lightning:
Hey, you wanna hang out again?

Piper:
Abso-toot-ly!

Lightning:
...On second thought…..

Piper:
Oh, quit it! I know your game.

Lightning:
What game?

Piper:
Doing this whole “tough guy” routine.

Lightning:
It’s not a “routine”!

Piper:
Uh-huh. And you’re not back for more?

Lightning:
I’m NOT-!

Lightning:
Ugh, whatever.

Lightning:
How do you know how to push all my buttons?

Piper:
It’s what I’m built for, silly!

Piper:
So what’d you wanna talk about?

Lightning:
You’re always digging things up, so I’m curious -
EndC

Choices
What’s the worst thing you’ve found?
What’s the best thing you’ve found?

Piper:
Ooooooooo, uh, well -

Piper:
That’s a toughie. 

Piper:
Human society broke down so long ago and….

Piper:
Well, to be honest, sometimes it’s hard to look at all this “junk” as you’d like to call it.

Piper:
So I guess, on one hand, everything I’ve come across is the worst thing I’ve found. 

Piper:
Toys, art, inventions, skyscrapers, homes -

Piper:
It all points to this exciting and bustling place!

Piper:
And that’s what I love about it! I really do!

Piper:
But at the same time-

Piper:
It makes seeing it all empty so much worse.

Piper:
There USED to be people here.

Piper:
People used to walk these roads. Play in these fields. Invent in those buildings.

Piper:
Seeing everything abandoned is sad sometimes.

Piper:
But I can’t let it get to me!

End

Piper:
Oooooo, uh, well-

Piper:
That’s a toughie.

Piper:
I mean, I love everything I come across!

Narrator:
*Piper holds up a metal bowl with lots of holes in it*

Piper:
I mean look at this thing? What the heck was this used for?

Piper:
My theory is that it’s a helmet of some sorts, to protect workers from certain substances.

Piper:
Or-Or from maybe falling debris when they were building these massive things!

Piper:
Right now, this is the best thing I’ve found!

Piper:
But tomorrow, it’ll probably be something else, and something else after that!

Piper:
Even though it’s all so old, it’ll always be new to me.

End

Piper:
Human society left so much behind, it would be irresponsible of me to not look at it all!

Piper:
What about you?

Lightning:
Me?

Piper:
Yeah, what do you think of human society?

Lightning:
Well, you know what I think.

Piper:
Nope.

Piper:
I know what you THOUGHT!

Piper:
But now you’ve seen more than you ever got to see in that desert.

Piper:
So what’s the verdict now?

Lightning:
Uh, well….
EndC

Choices
I still think it’s not worth looking into.
I think it’s interesting.

Lightning:
I still think it’s not worth looking into.

Lightning:
They all died a long time ago.

Lightning:
And I don’t wanna go sticking my hood into why that happened.

Piper:
*GASP!!!*

Lightning:
?

Lightning:
What?

Piper:
You just unironically used a car pun!!!

Lightning:
What? No I didn’t!

Piper:
*laughs*

Piper:
Yeah you did~!

Lightning:
Alright, fine, I did, whatever!
Piper:
This is so going into my journal-

Lightning:
ANYWAY -

Lightning:
My point is, why in the world would you want to go looking into how they all died?

Lightning:
What if that ends up happening to us too?

Lightning:
All because we were meddling with something we shouldn’t have.

Piper:
Oh, Lightning.

Piper:
That’s not what history’s about! 

Piper:
Yes, the humans all died but it was probably because of some stupid mistake!

Piper:
And mistakes happen. They happen to all of us!

Piper:
All we can do is try our best to prevent them.

Piper:
We can’t do that without acknowledging them.

End

Lightning:
Actually, I….

Lightning:
Yeah. I think it’s interesting.

Piper:
Oh, Lightning, you can’t always think that way! Remember you have to-

Piper:
…

Piper:
Wait.

Piper:
Did you say you…

Piper:
You DO think it’s interesting???

Lightning:
Well, yeah. 

Piper:
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!

Lightning:
…

Lightning:
Hello. Testing.

Lightning:
Cool, I didn’t just go deaf.

Piper:
THIS IS SO MOTORIFIC!

Piper:
You actually like this kinda stuff now?? You don’t think it’s junk?

Lightning:
Yeah, I guess?

Lightning:
I mean, you’re right. 

Lightning:
I’ve seen more in this rundown town than I ever would have seen in that desert.

Lightning:
And humans are….

Lightning:
Now, disclaimer, I still think you give humans way more credit than they deserve-

Lightning:
But after seeing all the stuff you’ve dug up….

Lightning:
I see now that they really did care about things. Other than killing the planet, anyways.

Lightning:
Ignoring it would just make us…

Piper:
Ignorant?

Lightning:
I was trying to find a word a little less on the nose, but yeah.

Piper:
I think you’re right!

Piper:
We can’t ignore their world history, because their world history is our world history!

End

Piper:
There’s an old human quote that goes-

Piper:
“Those who do not learn from history are doomed to eat it”

Lightning:
…

Lightning:
What the heck does that mean?

Piper:
I dunno, the words were pretty smeared -

Piper:
But-! I think it means we have to learn from the past to save our future!

Piper:
So that’s what I’m doing here. 

Piper:
Do you think that’s dumb?
EndC

Choices
Yep. Totally.
Not at all.

Piper:
Seriously?

Lightning: 
Yeah. But you know what-

Lightning:
You’re doing what you love. And you have a fun time with it.

End

Piper:
Really?

Lightning:
Yeah. It’s important for you guys to know what happened.

Lightning:
Like you said, you have to learn from the past.

Lightning:
In the end, I think that’s all that matters.

Piper:
Yeah. Thanks, Lightning. That makes me feel better!

Piper:
Well, I think we’d better hit the road again.

Piper:
It was a pleasure, as always!
