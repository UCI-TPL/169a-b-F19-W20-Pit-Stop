Lightning:
So about what happened earlier...

Mustang:
It's ok Lightning. I understand you want to leave. The humans have not been kind to this land.

Lightning:
I am sorry. I didn't mean to hurt anyone's feelings. I just wanted a way out.

Mustang:
I know. It's ok. We all forgive you. But remember that running away from problems is never the answer. 

Lightning:
Yea I suppose you're right. Anyway let's stop Gak!

Mustang:
Alright!

End

Lightning:
What are your plans after we stop Gak?

Mustang:
I reckon get back to work on that long distance communicator. If we're to fix this damn place them humans messed up, we'll need all the we can get!

Lightning:
Will you need help on it? Maybe I can help you out by finding more parts.

Mustang:
I sure will! Thanks, Lightning. Now go find the rest of these parts.

Lightning:
On it!
