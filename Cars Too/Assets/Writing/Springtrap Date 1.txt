Lightning:
Springtrap. 

Springtrap:
Yes?

Lightning:
Do you, uh, do you wanna hang out?

Springtrap:
...

$S3

Springtrap:
...why?

$S1

Lightning:
Well because...because uh, it'd give you a chance to keep your eye on me?

Lightning:
"Eyes on the rearview" and all that, right?

Springtrap:
...

$S5

Springtrap:
Okay, sounds good to me.

$S0

Springtrap:
Piper put you up to this, didn't she?

Lightning:
Oh...uh, yeah. Yeah, you got me.

Springtrap:
Hm, I figured.

Lightning:
So, humor me then?

Springtrap:
If it's for her, then sure. Got questions?

Lightning:
Actually, yeah.

Springtrap:
Go ahead. 

EndC

Choices
Do you like your job around here?
Do you like being part of the Spirit?

Springtrap:
My job?

$S3

Springtrap:
Well, it's A job.

$S5

Springtrap:
I just keep an eye on everyone, make sure no one's doing anything to stir up trouble.

$S0

Springtrap:
Which means I usually end up having to tow in a certain show-off from doing something stupid.

Lightning:
I'm gonna assume you're talking about Dex?

Springtrap:
OH yeah, I'm talking about Dex, that bigheaded, egotistical, loud-mouth, self-absORBED, CONCEITED-

$S7

Lightning:
WHOA, okay I get the idea. Not gonna bring up Dex again, check.

Springtrap:
Anyways, ASIDE from that good-for-nothing, I'll be honest and say the job is boring. 

$S0

Springtrap:
Nothin' happens most days so ya get to laze around, but ya also don't get to do much.

$S5

End

Springtrap:
Oh sure.

Springtrap:
I mean, this ain't no five-star hotel, you can tell that from one glance -

$S5

Springtrap:
- but this IS a team.

Springtrap:
The Spirit Crew has a surefire way to maintain ourselves and we have multiple people for conversations.

$S0

Springtrap:
Not having to worry about breaking down or going insane? That's a high score for me.

Springtrap:
Of course, I don't really think Mustang will be able to pull some hail-mary out of his trunk with all these parts we're finding....

$S5

Springtrap:
But it keeps us busy. And that's what matters.

$S0

End

Springtrap:
Aside from all that, rookie - 

Springtrap:
Being here is WAY better than being anywhere out there.

$S0

Springtrap:
I mean, sure, I can handle my own. No problems there.

$S3

Springtrap:
But out there again? Oh no. 

$S5

Springtrap:
You'd have to pay me a heckuva lot and THEN some if you think I'd so much as stick my tail light in that wilderness one more time.

$S0

Lightning:
Why? What do you think is out there?

Springtrap:
It's not about what's OUT there, rookie, it's about what's NOT out there.

Springtrap:
Namely - an actual life.

Springtrap:
You really think I'd enjoy aimlessly wandering junkyards for the rest of the time I have in this body?

$S3

Springtrap:
No way. I'd take Dex every day of my life if it meant not spending one day alone in the wilderness.

$S5

Lightning:
I'm going to assume you had a bad time there-?

Springtrap:
Lightning, I'll talk to you about literally anything else.

$S0

Lightning:
Right. So...

EndC

Choices
How did you join the Spirit?
How did you become good friends with Piper?

Springtrap:
Chief and Mustang came along.

$S0

Springtrap:
To tell ya the truth, they didn't even hafta try convincing me of their "great cause" or whatever.

$S5

Springtrap:
I woulda gone with them either way. It was something new, something different.

Springtrap:
But I will say that I stayed because of their purpose.

$S0

Springtrap:
I don't always agree with Chief and I'll do things on my own - with or without our dear leader's permission - but...

Springtrap:
I won't lie and say I'm just here for a safe place. I'm here because there's a goal in mind. 

Springtrap: Even if I don't think we'll get there anytime soon.

$S5

Lightning:
I see. That makes sense.

Springtrap:
Why are YOU here?

$S0

Lightning:
Me? 

Springtrap:
See anyone else, genius?

Lightning:
Well, it's just like Piper probably already told you. I'm here to help.

Springtrap:
Yeah, but why?

$S5

Lightning:
Cuz...Piper told me to?

Lightning:
Look, I don't really need a reason, do I?

Springtrap:
You do if you intend on sticking around.

$S0

End

Springtrap:
Oh yeah, that gal.

$S0

Springtrap:
Piper and I didn't really get off to a great start.

$S5

Springtrap:
For starters, she's a total nerd. Really cramps my style, ya know?

$S0

Springtrap:
But she's the only one here who has everyone else's best interests in mind.

$S3

Springtrap:
I assumed everyone was just in it for themselves until she showed up.

$S5

Springtrap:
If you talk to her, you'll know what I mean. 

$S0

Springtrap:
When I first got here, I tried to avoid her. But her personality can be...

$S5

Lightning:
Overwhelming?

Springtrap:
Yeah, that's the word. I just wanted to keep to myself, but she just wouldn't leave me alone.

$S0

Lightning:
I know the feeling.

Springtrap:
And, ya know...I'm very grateful for that. 

$S3

Springtrap:
Everyone's got flaws and hers was not understanding boundaries. Like, at all.

$S0

Springtrap:
But because of that, she genuinely taught me a lot. About what this world was before. About what it could be again, if we're successful here...

$S3

Springtrap:
So even though I'll call her annoying sometimes - which she definitely is -

$S5

Springtrap:
I wouldn't change that wagon for the world.

$S0

End

Springtrap:
Let me tell you something.

Springtrap:
The people you see around here? They ain't perfect.

$S5

Springtrap:
I won't hide the fact that some of them get on my nerves.

$S0

Springtrap:
But I also won't hide the fact that they're my family now, and I'll protect them no matter the cost.

$S7

Springtrap:
Do you get the picture now, new motor?

$S0

Lightning:
To be honest? Not really.

Springtrap:
Whaddya mean?

$S1

Lightning:
I don't know how else to say it but that "family" is sort of a foreign term for me.

Lightning:
I don't....really get it. But the way you describe it. It sounds nice.

Springtrap:
...

Springtrap:
*laughs*

$S2

Lightning:
Whoa, was that a real smile?

Springtrap:
NO. 

$S7

Springtrap:
That was a pity laugh, because THAT was probably the most pathetic thing I've ever heard.

$S0

Lightning:
Oh sure, thanks, I'm glad my existence is a joke to you.

Springtrap:
Ahhh, not like that, I don't mean to make fun of ya. What I mean is...

$S5

Springtrap:
You sound like the type of person who could really use a family. At least a couple of friends wouldn't hurt.

$S0

Springtrap:
And hey, if you want to stick around a little while longer....

$S5

Springtrap:
Well...why don't you hit me up again?

$S0

Springtrap:
This chat was surprisingly not the worst thing in the world.
