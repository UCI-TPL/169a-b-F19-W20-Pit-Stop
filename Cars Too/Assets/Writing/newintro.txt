Piper:
THERE you are! I was started to worry you wouldn't show! 

Lightning:
Yeah, well....I figured it would be worth getting the parts I need. Worth even putting up with you.

Piper:
Awwww, that's sweet!

Lightning:
That wasn't a compliment.

Piper:
*laughs* I take what I can get in the post-apocalypse.

Chief:
And who's this we have here?

Piper:
Oh, perfect timing! I was about to suggest introductions!

Piper:
Lightning, this is Chief. They - 

Chief:
Would like to introduce themself, thank you, Piper.

Piper:
Okie dokie! I'll let you take it from here.

Piper:
Lightning, I'll be nearby if you wanna come chat!

Piper:
And don't forget to introduce yourself to the rest of the crew!

Piper:
They'll be around.

Narrator:
*Piper leaves*

Lightning:
So, Chief, right?

Chief:
It's a pleasure to meet you, Lightning. You know, Piper's been off her rims waiting for you to arrive.

Lightning:
Can't imagine a good reason why.

Chief:
Heh, well, whether you like it or not, that girl thinks you're somethin'. We'll see if that's true in a minute.

Lightning:
What do you mean?

Chief:
I mean I'm gonna show you the ropes on parts retrieval. The way WE do it. You did come to help out, didn't you?

Lightning:
Y-Yeah. I did.

Chief:
Then let's get started.
