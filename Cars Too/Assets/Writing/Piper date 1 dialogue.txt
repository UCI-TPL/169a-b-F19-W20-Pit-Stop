Lightning:
Hey, I was wondering'

Piper:
Yes?

Lightning:
If you wanted to...uh...I guess talk about that history some more?

Lightning:
I'm coming across more and more remnants of the past in this wasteland....

Lightning:
I can't help but wonder if there's more to them than what I'm seeing.

Piper:
Oh!!! Are you-!

$P2

Lightning:
DON'T get your hopes up, it's not like any dead human is gonna keep me from leaving. I'm just curious is all.

Lightning:
And, well'You're the one to go to for that kinda stuff.

Lightning:
So do you wanna hang out or-?

Piper:
YES! Yes, I'd love to hang out! 

Piper:
What do you wanna talk about first?

Why do you care about this junk?
What's your newest discovery?

Piper:
Junk!?

$P4

Piper:
I thought you said you wanted to learn more about what I do!

Lightning:
I do! 

Lightning:
Still not past calling it junk. 

Piper:
Oh, Lightning. It's not just junk, it's really cool junk! Stuff that I have the privilege of studying!

$P5

End

Piper:
OO OO OO!

$P2

Lightning:
No like that sound.

Piper:
You really wanna see!?

$P0

Lightning:
To be honest, I'm kinda hesitant now. 

Narrator:
(Piper unveils a very shiny piece of what looks like aluminum foil)

Piper:
THIS is my latest discovery!

$P2

Lightning:
...

Lightning:
...what is it?

Piper:
Oh hoh hoh, I'm glad you asked!

$P5

Lightning:
I feel like you just waited for me to-

Piper:
THIS is - based on my analysis - a KEE-LON-DEE-KAY bar.

$P0

Lightning:
What's it do?

Piper:
I'm not sure, but it must have, once upon a time, done something VERY important. My past research leads me to believe that people from all over the globe would do anything imaginable to get one.

Lightning:
But it doesn't do anything?

Piper:
Nnnnot that I can tell? But I'm sure it served some incredible purpose way back when! 

Piper:
It's cool stuff like this that I get to trail blaze!

$P2

End

Piper:
See, when the Awakening happened, all us cars woke up, right?

$P0

Piper:
NO IDEA what happened, who we were or where we were headed!

Piper:
All we know is that humans *used* to be here, and now they aren't! Why do you think that is?

Lightning:
I dunno, you're the historian.

Piper:
EXACTLY! I'm the historian! I get to find that out!

$P2

Piper:
I get to learn about a past we were never a part of, a time so different from now that it's practically alien.

$P5

Piper:
EVERYTHING is new! And there's so much to learn!

$P0 

Piper:
How could you NOT care about junk when it could tell you stories of times past and people gone, tales of heartache and drama and joy and thrill and - and - !

$P2

Piper:
It's just all so amazing! It's like stepping into a brand new world.

Piper:
A world that's...

$P0

Piper:
...that's not as lonely as this one.

$P3

Choices
You feel lonely?
It doesn't have to be that way.

Piper:
Hm?

$P1

Piper:
Oh! N-No! I mean-....Well'.

$P6

Piper:
*sighs*

$P3

Piper:
I guess I do feel kinda lonely sometimes. Springtrap's an awesome friend and Chief is really great too, but, sometimes it's hard to get along with Dex and Mustang.

Lightning:
That's hard to believe. You're sort of annoyingly easy to get along with. I'm surprised you haven't made friendship bracelets for everyone yet.

Piper:
*laughs* They're in progress, it's hard to find the right materials! 

$P5

Lightning:
So what makes those two so hard to get along with?

Piper:
Well, Dex is always getting himself into trouble and making me a worrywart, and Mustang is a fantastic machinist, but they...

$P3

Piper:
They talk about humans in this rude way that I just can't get behind.

$P4

Piper:
Sometimes, I wish they'd both see things my way, you know?

$P3

Piper:
And that kind of stuff makes me feel lonely! But that's not the only reason.

$P0

End

Piper:
What do you mean?

$P1

Lightning:
Oh, well, uh, I mean...

Lightning:
I mean, you have the whole Spirit crew behind you. There's no reason for you to feel lonely.

Lightning:
If anyone is supposed to feel lonely, it should be me. And that's only because I've literally been alone in the desert for 6 years. 

Piper:
*laughs* True, true. 

$P2

Piper:
But I really wish you hadn't been!

$P0

Lightning:
I know, I know-

Piper:
Seriously, how many times did I have to call before you got your trunk up here?

$P5

Lightning:
48.

Piper:
And you were always-!

$P6

Piper:
Wait. 

$P3

Piper:
You actually counted?

$P1

Lightning:
Piper, there are *very* few things you can do in a virtually empty desert. If you can think of an inane activity, I've probably done it. 

Piper:
Oh, I wish you had come join the crew sooner! We need each other!

$P0

End

Piper:
Lightning, we're all that's left. The crew's been together for years, and in all that time, we've never found another car.

$P3

Piper:
Everyday I try the radio frequencies to see if I pick anything up, but no one ever comes through.

Piper:
So, of course I'm lonely! We don't get a great big kingdom or empire or-or society or whatever!

$P6

Piper:
Sometimes I'm really jealous of those humans. They had so many people to go to and interact with and have fun with. 

$P4

Piper:
I just wish we could find that, some day.

$P5

Lightning:
Don't you already have that?

Piper:
What?

$P3

Lightning:
It's the Spirit, isn't it? What you're talking about?

Lightning:
People having fun with each other, working together, all that? That's what you guys do already, right?

Piper:
...

Piper:
*laughs* I guess you're right! 

$P2

Piper:
All we have is each other...

$P5

Piper:
I didn't realize I needed to be reminded of that.

Piper:
You know, Lightning...

Piper:
I really am grateful you decided to come join.

$P0

Piper:
Even if it IS just because you wanna scram.

$P2

Piper:
Well! I guess we should get back to work.

$P0

Piper:
Thanks for hanging out with me today! It was a blast!
