Lightning:
Hey, I was wondering…

Piper:
Yes?

Lightning:
If you wanted to...uh...I guess talk about that history some more?

Lightning:
I’m coming across more and more remnants of the past in this wasteland....

Lightning:
I can’t help but wonder if there’s more to them than what I’m seeing.

Piper:
Oh!!! Are you-!

Lightning:
DON’T get your hopes up, it’s not like any dead human is gonna keep me from leaving. I’m just curious is all.

Lightning:
And, well…You’re the one to go to for that kinda stuff.

Lightning:
So do you wanna hang out or-?

Piper: 
YES! Yes, I’d love to hang out! 

Piper:
What do you wanna talk about first?

What’s your newest discovery?
Why do you care about this junk?

Piper:
One second.

End

Piper:
Junk!?

Piper:
I thought you said you wanted to learn more about what I do!
Lightning:
I do! 

Lightning:
Still not past calling it junk. 

Piper:
Oh, Lightning. It’s not just junk, it’s really cool junk! Stuff that I have the privilege of studying!

Piper:
OO OO OO!

Lightning:
No like that sound.

Piper:
You really wanna see!?

Lightning:
To be honest, I’m kinda hesitant now.

Piper:
*Piper unveils a very shiny piece of what looks like aluminum foil*


Piper:
THIS is my latest discovery!

Lightning:
...

Lightning:
...what is it?

Piper:
Oh hoh hoh, I’m glad you asked!

Lightning:
I feel like you just waited for me to-

Piper:
THIS is - based on my analysis - a KEE-LON-DEE-KAY bar.

Lightning:
What’s it do?

Piper:
I’m not sure, but it must have, once upon time, done something VERY important. My past research leads me to believe that people from all over the globe would do anything imaginable to get one.

Lightning:
But it doesn’t do anything?

Piper:
Nnnnot that I can tell? But I’m sure it served some incredible purpose way back when! 

Piper:
It’s cool stuff like this that I get to trail blaze!

Piper:
See, when the Awakening happened, all us cars woke up, right?

Piper:
NO IDEA what happened, who we were or where we were headed!

Piper:
All we know is that humans *used* to be here, and now they aren’t! Why do you think that is?

Lightning:
I dunno, you’re the historian.

Piper:
EXACTLY! I’m the historian! I get to find that out!

Piper:
I get to learn about a past we were never a part of, a time so different from now that it’s practically alien.

Piper:
EVERYTHING is new! And there’s so much to learn! 

Piper:
How could you NOT care about junk when it could tell you stories of times past and people gone, tales of heartache and drama and joy and thrill and - and - !

Piper:
It’s just all so amazing! It’s like stepping into a brand new world.

Piper:
A world that’s...

Piper:
...that’s not as lonely as this one.

You feel lonely?
It doesn’t have to be that way.

Piper:
Hm?

Piper:
Oh! N-No! I mean-....Well….

Piper:
*sighs*

Piper:
I guess I do feel kinda lonely sometimes. Springtrap’s an awesome friend and Chief is really great too, but, sometimes it’s hard to get along with Dex and Mustang.

Lightning:
That’s hard to believe. You’re sort of annoyingly easy to get along with. I’m surprised you haven’t made friendship bracelets for everyone yet.

Piper:
*laughs* I’ll take that as a compliment. 

Lightning:
So what makes those two so hard to get along with?

Piper:
Well, Dex is always getting himself into trouble and making me a worrywart, and Mustang is a fantastic machinist, but they…

Piper:
They talk about humans in this rude way that I just can’t get behind.

Piper:
Sometimes, I wish they’d both see things my way, you know?

Piper:
And that kind of stuff makes me feel lonely! But that’s not the only reason.

End

Piper:
What do you mean?

Lightning:
Oh, well, uh, I mean...

Lightning:
I mean, you have the whole Spirit crew behind you. There’s no reason for you to feel lonely.

Lightning:
If anyone is supposed to feel lonely, it should be me. And that’s only because I’ve literally been alone in the desert for 6 years. 

Piper:
*laughs* True, true. 

Piper:
But I really wish you hadn’t been!

Lightning:
I know, I know-

Piper:
Seriously, how many times did I have to call before you got your trunk up here?

Lightning:
48.

Piper:
And you were always-!

Piper:
Wait. 

Piper:
You actually counted?

Lightning:
Piper, there are *very* few things you can do in a virtually empty desert. If you can think of an inane activity, I’ve probably done it. 

Piper:
Oh, I wish you had come join the crew sooner! We need each other!

End

Piper:
Lightning, we’re all that’s left. The crew’s been together for years, and in all that time, we’ve never found another car.

Piper:
Everyday I try the radio frequencies to see if I pick anything up, but no one ever comes through.

Piper:
So, of course I’m lonely! We don’t get a great big kingdom or empire or-or society or whatever!

Piper:
Sometimes I’m really jealous of those humans. They had so many people to go to and interact with and have fun with. 

Piper:
I just wish we could find that, some day.

Lightning:
Don’t you already have that?

Piper:
What?

Lightning:
It’s the Spirit, isn’t it? What you’re talking about?

Lightning:
People having fun with each other, working together, all that? That’s what you guys do already, right?

Piper:
...

Piper:
*laughs* I guess you’re right! 

Piper:
All we have is each other. Thank you for reminding me of that.

Piper:
You know, I really am grateful you decided to come join.

Piper:
Even if it IS just because you wanna scram.

Piper:
Well! I guess we should get back to work.

Piper:
Thanks for hanging out with me today! It was a blast!
