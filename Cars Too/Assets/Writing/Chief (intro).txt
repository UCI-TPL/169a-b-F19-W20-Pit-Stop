Chief:
Scavenging for parts isn't as easy as it looks. You'd think a junkyard would have parts left and right, but we're looking for GOOD parts. 

Chief:
Parts that won't break if someone sneezed on 'em. If you wanna help out, THOSE are the parts you're going to be looking for.

Chief:
Around here, you're going to be finding COGS. They look like this one right here. 

Chief:
Snag any you can find. Once you've got 4, you can come on back to me to move on to the next scavenging location.

Chief:
Any questions?

Choices
How long have you been doing this?
How did the Spirit crew come about?

Chief:
*laughs*

Chief:
I know it might seem like I've been doing this for a while, but I'm not the first car in the crew to wake up.

Chief:
That honor goes Mustang. They've been here longer than any of us. 

Chief:
They also figured out how to put on hats. Which, truth be told, I'm still trying to figure out the science behind. 

Chief:
In any case...

End

Chief:
The Spirit came about because of me, so to speak.

Chief:
When I awoke, it didn't take me long to realize that the world as it is now, is not what it should be.

Chief:
I still don't know what our exact place in it is, but I know we can have a part in restoring what once was. 

Chief:
So I founded the Spirit. It was just me n Mustang to begin with, but we found Springtrap not long after. Dex came along, then Piper, and here we all are.

End

Chief:
We're here to make a change. And now you are too. 

Lightning:
...

Chief:
Now, I don't mean to put any pressure on you, you just got here, after all. But you'll get the hang of it soon. You just need a bit of practice. So go on out there and get it!
