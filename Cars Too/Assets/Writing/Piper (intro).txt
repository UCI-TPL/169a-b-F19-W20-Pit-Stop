Piper:
Heya! What's revvin'! Need some help?

$P0

Lightning:
Yeah, can you tell me again why you dragged me out here?

Piper:
Cuz you need some fresh air!

$P2

Lightning:
You're really gonna call rummaging around a junkyard for parts "getting fresh air"?

Piper:
Well, it's definitely better than aimlessly wandering a desert all by yourself.

$P5

Lightning:
...

Lightning:
Clearly, you and I are on different pages when it comes to having a good time.

Piper:
Oh, don't be such a rusty wheel! Would it really kill you to interact with other people once in a while?

$P3

Lightning:
...

Piper:
Well?

$P1

Lightning:
Huh? Oh, sorry, I stopped listening after that horrendous "rusty wheel" pun. What'd you say?

Piper:
DUSTY!!! This is what I'm talking about! You make every interaction with another person seem like the worst thing in the world.

$P4

Lightning:
I mean, it IS up there. And you've gotta stop calling me that.

Piper:
What? Dusty?

$P5

Lightning:
I have a full name you know. 

Piper:
But it's so cute! And it suits you!

$P2

Lightning:
*sigh* Just because I got a LITTLE bit dirty in the desert doesn't mean-

Piper:
Nope, it's Dusty. I've decided.

$P0

Piper:
First lesson in Social Interaction 101 - 

Piper:
A nickname stays forever.

$P5

Piper:
Now get on out there an learn some more lessons!

$P2

Lightning:
Do I HAVE to?

Piper:
Yes, grumpy. If you still want parts for your little scheme, that is.

$P5

Lightning:
It's not a scheme! It's just a...

Lightning:
...secret...plan...thing.

Piper:
Mhm. Whatever you say.

Lightning:
Whatever. I'm not gonna find anything just sitting here, so I'm gonna head out.

Piper:
Take care!

$P0

Piper:
Oh, and don't you dare just leave without telling me! I've got your radio frequency on hotline!

$P4

Lightning:
I won't.

Lightning:
...probably.

Piper:
What was that?

$P1

Lightning:
Nothing!
